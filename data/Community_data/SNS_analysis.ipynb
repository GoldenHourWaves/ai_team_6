Are you guys still actually wanting to hear our thoughts are whether the government is going to allow the housing market to crash The phrase stuck on stupid comes to mind Once again housing still so far out of touch for most Canadians and it was only a matter of time before it because a political issue A political issue where if a politician wanted to keep their job and get elected or reelected something had to happen Housing cost Trudeau his job Entire demographics changed Housing is the number one political issue in Canada and most of the world if you look globally Housing affordability is the number one issue among all the federal parties Period Full stop The new OSFI rules make sense I think the era of mom and pop investing is done It was built on a faulty foundation It will be cooperations or if were lucky not for profits There are 6000 housing coops in Vancouver where people pay 30 of their incomes to live Seniors and single moms 400 to 800 in rent a month With 4 bed town homes having max rents of 2000 a month And no one is going to sell and force you out That stability allows for their kids to get educations and to thrive Immigration and TFW Programs have been cut The writing is in the wall and has been for two years\n",
