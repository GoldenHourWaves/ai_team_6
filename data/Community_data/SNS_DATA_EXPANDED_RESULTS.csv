https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qi6689/500m_liquidated_overnight_when_did_we_normalize/,Reddit,Post,reogin,"Woke up this morning, opened crypto Twitter — $500M+ liquidations overnight.

My reaction? “Oh. Another Tuesday.”  
And that scared me more than the number itself.

Back in October, that $19B liquidation day when BTC nuked from $126k felt apocalyptic. People were genuinely shaken. Now we see $300–500M liquidation events almost weekly and the timeline just… moves on.

Here's what bothers me: I've been liquidated twice this year. Not because my thesis was wrong or I overleveraged like an idiot. Both times, the exchange went ""under maintenance"" during the dump.

First time: Binance, March. BTC drops 12% in 8 minutes. I try to close my position → ""Error: system overload."" Try mobile app → same thing. Try to add margin → ""Deposits temporarily disabled."" Position liquidated at literally the worst tick. 23 minutes later, everything works fine.

Second time: Different CEX, similar story. Price crashes, platform freezes, liquidation goes through, platform unfreezes. $4.7k gone.

I'm not even mad anymore. I'm just numb to it. And that's the problem.

We've all collectively decided that:  
Exchanges going down during volatility = normal  
$500M erased in a few hours = just another day  
Getting liquidated due to ""technical issues"" = part of the game

When did this become acceptable?

I've been looking at non-custodial perps (Phantom, Trust Wallet, etc.) because at least if I get rekt, it's my own fault and not because some server conveniently crashed. Found Atomic Wallet's version lets you deposit via TRX-USDT – $0.50 fees instead of $15 on Ethereum. Small thing, but when you're paranoid about leaving funds on CEXs, it matters.

But here's my actual question:  
If you've been liquidated multiple times this year, why are you still trading perps?

I'm genuinely asking. Not judging, I'm still here too, somehow. But what's the thesis? Are we making money long-term, or just paying for the dopamine hit of 10x leverage while pretending it's ""strategy""?

Because from where I'm sitting, perps feel less like trading and more like betting against:  
Liquidation cascades you can't predict  
Stop-loss hunting algorithms  
Exchange outages that always happen during dumps (funny how that works)

Be honest with yourself: if leverage trading disappeared tomorrow, would you miss the strategy – or just the rush?

I don't have the answer. Maybe I'm being dramatic. Maybe this is just what trading looks like now and I need to adapt or leave.  
But I can't shake the feeling that we've all normalized something deeply broken.",1768927473.0,47

If the stock market drops, bitcoin will definitely drop initially ... but give it some time and wait for the actual bull run to start. The harder the market crashes, the more bitcoin will behave like gold.",1761844802.0,2

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ok2hxm/bitcoin_risks_2030_drop_as_crypto_markets/,Reddit,Comment,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant drop, revisiting the bottom of its local range near $107,000, as crypto markets saw $1.1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. This decline followed a 0.25% interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and uncertainty surrounding a potential US-China trade deal. Analysts warn of a potential 20-30% further drop in BTC prices, especially if stock markets face a correction. October 2025 marked a rare 'red' month for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency struggling to maintain its usual October gains.

Then I kept buying dips.. and now here we are.

I felt devastated in January 2025. The rest of 2025 has felt worse. And what's funny is before October 10th things felt dismal, then the liquidation event happened and the market is even more dismal than before.

Every few months since January of 2025 I didn't want to sell because my balance was so much lower than before. Then lower than before that. And then even lower than before that. And now everyone thinks it's going way lower.

I would have been much better off (comparatively speaking) to have sold everything Jan 2025. And hell, now, even selling it all early October 2025 before the liquidation event.

Now my bags are so incredibly negative, I just don't know what to do. Like the title says, selling in extreme fear feels so backwards and wrong. But nobody knows how much lower we are going.. even though we've already come so low. Not sure I can afford to hold through an entire bear market/crypto winter.

The easy part is to buy, so do it on the right time. The hardest part is to sell, especially if you need to cut losses. 

My tip to you is: There's no painless solution. Adjust your portfolio according to YOUR risk assessment. Sell what need to be sold and be prepared to whatever comes to the market. Forget how you will ""appear"" to the community. The 'community' won't be there for you when you need money for whatever it is that you are investing for.

\- IF this is the beginning of a bear (which is my guess) we are not going to see new ATH. Maybe a 'dead cat bounce' (much lower than previous highs) to then run to the bottom. How would you approach that?

The midterms next year are coming. The GOP are going to move heaven and earth to pump the markets to keep the wheels turning, ultimately taking possession of the levers at the fed. 

Interest rates will plummet and the printer will turned to 11. I'd say by eoQ2 that the mkt will WAY above ATH's, perhaps through to EOY.

Cashout stablecoins and then try repay the borrowed stablecoins as soon as possible (still risky, opens you up to liquidation still and depegging events can also mess you up, also smart contract risks as usual with crypto on-chain, if you were to do this please for the love of God keep the LTV as low as humanly possible and pay it off as quickly as you can)

Honestly I wouldn't recommend either. Both could lead to even more of a disaster, but it could be an option potentially.

I was in your shoes in 2017/2021, I decided to ""HODL"" because of bad advice on sites like these... and it was the worst decision ever. The bags kept getting heavier, the losses higher. Many alts never recovered, are basically dead now. I would rather have had 50% of my value (or whatever), than what it's worth now. Even after 2 cycles (8 years) with 2 new BTC ATHs, the once top alt coins  are now -90% or even more.

Alts are absolute SHIT to hodl. Why? Because every cycle brings a new artificial hype (NFT, Layer2, AI, etc...), and it wont be the same hype/topic in the next cycle, so most alts you buy now won't be relevant/hyped at all next cycle.

And even BTC... if you sell now, you can buy back in cheaper in the next year or so and you'll end up with more BTC than you have now.

I know it really, really hurts to sell at a loss, but the ""sunk cost fallacy"" is REAL. It's so psychologically blinding that it makes you make bad decisions. So let's say you bought .1 BTC for 10k and now its worth 7k. You don't want to sell, because you lose 3k. Well, the question is: would you buy that same .1 BTC right now for 7k (thinking it's a good or bad deal/time to buy)? If you wouldn't buy, then it means you should sell.

The decline followed a record liquidation event triggered by President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which caused Bitcoin to drop from $126,000 to near $104,800. Market uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and the Federal Reserve's resistance to further rate cuts contributed to the downturn. Despite the loss, Bitcoin remains up over 16% year-to-date.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gy95bs/this_current_bull_run_may_be_coming_to_an_end/,Reddit,Post,[deleted],"As the title states, I believe we are nearing the end of this bull run. Give or take 2-4 months, remaining.

Based on the patterns of previous bull runs and the current state of the cryptocurrency market, we can make some educated guesses from breaking down the previous runs.

Duration of Past Bull Markets:

2016–2017: This cycle lasted roughly 1.5 years. It began in early 2016 and ended in December 2017/January (early) 2018 when prices peaked.

2020–2021: The bull run in 2020–2021 lasted approximately 1.5 years as well, starting in March 2020 after the COVID-19 crash and ending in November 2021 when Bitcoin hit $68,000 - 69,000

Current Cycle (2023–2024/2025): If we are following a similar timeline, we could see a similar 1.5-year duration for this cycle, with the peak potentially occurring around late 2024 or early 2025.

All the bull runs begin to gain movement once the halving approaches and ends. 

Post-Halving Cycle: Historically, Bitcoin’s price tends to peak about 6 to 12 months after a halving, meaning we would see the strongest price increases from mid-2024 to early 2025. 

In conclusion, my opinion is this run could be ending in December or early 2025. I don't see BTC sky rocketing to 250k this cycle, as some have said. I don't even think 150k is possible. I think we get over that 100k hump, for sure....but the correction is going to be there.

We are already due for a  correction (as most crypto vets should be aware of) and I'd predict that in December.

This of course is my opinion, and is not financial advice.

I would like to see what everyone else has for an opinion on those matter. And yes I'm aware, no one really knows. But we can make educated guesses.",1732394064.0,45

Bull runs are correlated not just with the bitcoin halving but also with the US election cycle. A year of growth then peaks in late 2013, late 2017, late 2021, and next will likely be late 2025. Anomalous peaks and troughs are usually event-led and that's what is happening now. Trump won, Musk is head of DOGE and there's talk of a strategic btc reserve, so we have premature lift-off, which cannot be sustained for a year. So yes, this will fizzle but I expect a huge resurgence and peak in late 2025.

A crypto-friendly administration is going to give this longer runway.

- Naming the next head of the SEC. We all know Gensler is gone 1/20/25. Whoever his replacement is will probably be crypto-friendly and when the choice is made the market will go up.

- If the strategic Bitcoin reserve gains traction and becomes a thing, the market will go up.

- Legitimacy of Bitcoin and crypto in general is growing. Other companies I think will join the fray leading to more buy pressure. Increased legitimacy will lead to less unfavorable swings and price will start to level out.

Could definitely see $100-125K per Bitcoin with 1/20/25 getting closer and naming Gensler’s replacement. The market will pull back because people taking profit, maybe back down to $75K, but I believe Bitcoin will hold. We’re not going back down to $50K or less IMO, unless something absolutely catastrophic occurs.

I use the halving day as my starting point.  I would put the top somewhere between April-November 2025 if all else is equal.  As far as the halving cycle goes it would be early to say we are near the top.  We will certainly have some decent sized corrections over the next year or so but, at least on the time scale I am thinking, we won't enter a true bear market.

As far as your price predictions, which is &lt; 150k... I would say that, in a vacuum, 120-150k would be reasonable but with the other macro events going on I would be surprised if we didn't go over 150k.  

Anyways, we will see.  No hate for someone doing their own analysis that doesn't agree with my own.  If I could guarantee to be right 51% of the time I would be making a millions of dollars every day :)",1732486104.0,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o6kjsz/btc_still_looks_strong_to_me_even_after_that/,Reddit,Post,Emotional-Fig-4105,"Been watching Bitcoin closely this week, and honestly, the price action looks way stronger than most people realize. BTC is sitting around $116K, and after that $19B liquidation flush, it bounced back almost immediately. Thats not weak price action, that’s real demand kicking in.

When I checked the onchain data, it showed something interesting, accumulation actually spiked during the dip around $109K. So while everyone was panicking, wallets with size were quietly stacking. That’s the kind of move I’ve seen before big pushes in past cycles.

Right now I’m eyeing the $110K–$108K range as a key zone to hold. If BTC keeps defending that area and volume starts picking up again, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a leg up soon. ETF flows are still positive, and institutional sentiment feels quietly bullish.

Feels like one of those times where the market looks shaky on the surface, but it’s just setting up for something bigger. Not financial advice, just what I’m seeing on my charts.

Bloomberg ran the headline today. Fourth annual loss. First one without a scandal attached.  No exchange collapsed. No founder arrested. No rug pull.  Just... boredom.

The tourists are checking out.  Here's what the tourists never understand: the boring parts are the feature, not the bug. Every technological shift follows the same arc. Ridicule. Resistance. Magazine cover. But between resistance and magazine cover? There's a long, quiet stretch where nothing seems to happen.

That's the dip.

The dip is where most people quit. Not because they failed—because they got tired of waiting.  I watched this happen in 2014. In 2018. In 2022. The headlines screamed death. The believers kept building. The difference between a tourist and a settler isn't conviction. It's tolerance for boredom.

Tourists need the dopamine of daily gains. Settlers understand that positioning happens in the quiet. The same information is available to everyone. The Fed's moves. The ETF flows. The macro headwinds. But information without the patience to act on it is just noise.

Risk isn't about volatility.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1povh2n/the_fatigue_filter/,Reddit,Comment,Budo00,"If someone's expressing Bitcoin fatigue—feeling burned out from the volatility, endless hype cycles, or the current dip—here are some empathetic, balanced things you could say, depending on the vibe. Right now (mid-December 2025), Bitcoin's hovering around $87,000–$90,000 after peaking over $126,000 in October, with low volumes and ETF outflows signaling widespread exhaustion. It's on track for a rare annual loss without a major scandal, just plain market weariness.
Empathetic and Neutral Responses
(If you want to validate their feelings without pushing):

""Yeah, I get it—the constant ups and downs are exhausting. It's been a wild ride this year, and right now everything feels stuck in neutral. Totally fair to tune out for a bit.""
""Bitcoin fatigue is real. We've seen these quiet, frustrating stretches before where nothing exciting happens. No shame in stepping back and focusing on other things.""

Encouraging for Long-Term Believers
(If they're open to a gentle nudge):

""These boring, sideways phases are actually the feature, not the bug. The hype brings in the crowds, but the quiet times filter out the tourists and let the network keep building. Hang in there if you believe in the fundamentals.""
""Zoom out: Even with this dip, Bitcoin's still up massively over multi-year cycles. Periods like this (low energy, fear in the air) have historically been when smart accumulation happens. Extreme fear often marks turning points.""
""Buy the dip? Only if it fits your plan—but yeah, weakness like this has preceded big moves up in past cycles. Patience is the hardest part.""

Light-Hearted or Meme-Inspired
(To keep it fun):

""Welcome to the fatigue filter. The ones who stick around through the boredom are the ones who win long-term.""
""HODL through the snooze fest. We're all gonna make it (WAGMI)... eventually.""

If They're Really Over It

""No worries if you're done—crypto isn't for everyone, especially when it's dragging like this. Plenty of other ways to invest or just live life without checking charts every day.""

The key is empathy first. Bitcoin's history is full of these lulls (2014–2016, 2018–2020, 2022), and they've always ended with new highs eventually. But forcing optimism on someone who's tapped out rarely helps. Listen more than you talk.",1765983644.0,0

The fact that the price isn’t pumping they say is due to manipulation of the market but the sceptic in me thinks that using manipulation as a scapegoat for why the price isn’t going up is an easy way to create a boogie man that most people can’t prove.

I know that obviously the Blockchain is public but if it was that easy to just spot the manipulation going on surely everyone would know and it wouldn’t work.. 

So my question is and bearing in mind I am relatively new to crypto (2/3yr lurker) are there other ways to prove this market manipulation and answer the question of whether or not it’s happening and therefore gain more accurate view of the value of bitcoin and crypto. 

Or am I just asking to predict the future..

What you are perceiving as 'manipulation' is the natural eb and flow of a true free market, the price you see is the volatility of the fiat money it is priced in, and its comparison to the opinions of all the market participants.

They can print stock, for example, by borrowing it and selling it onto the market to prevent it from going up (shorting)... but this can't be done with BTC (only derivatives of BTC, like ETFs...). That's a deeper topic, but needless to say, derivative stuff doesn't stop exchanges from managing real supply/demand

What they can do is actually the opposite. And I'm seeing signs of it on the blockchain. They can prevent a finite thing from going down quite easily. They also have an incentive to do this now that billionaires and corporations are buying BTC with no intent to sell. As a simple high level explanation of this, imagine an entity like Black Rock 'borrowing' (through bonds or other constructs; leveraging debt) billions to buy BTC at floor point and prevent it from falling. They can do this...

So while they can set off flash crashes when there is illiquidity in markets (it might only take 1,000 BTC sold to fill the order book and give the impression of panic selling)... it doesn't work when a floor has been established in that illiquid market and others are waiting for this behavior to buy... we've been seeing that at $92k...

So, my feeling is that institutions, and large players are creating the velocity upwards when they can leverage to benefit most from it... then they stop the price in a range (like what we've seen 92-108k..) they are using micro manipulation within this range to shake people (fomo in when it looks like ATH is testing) and flash crashes to $92 that buy back up fast). The reason they do this... is because if they can use just 1,000 to set offf some panic from $105k, and get the price to run down to $94k fast... they can buy those 1,000 and some more as it approaches those zone where heavy buying is waiting... so they can sell 1,000 and buy back 1,500 for example... they've been doing this the last few months... 

Eventually when they aren't able to make BTC doing this (eventually the panic will stop to the point that no one sells when we see a drop from 99k to 92k ... then they will let this run up to the next zone... and they'll repeat. I suspect we're done with cycles in BTC. I think in the long run we're still going to see 30% or more gains per year, but we'll get these 3-6 month long drawn out sideways events. This is how institutions who have time on their side and want to just buy and get as much as they can operate. They will try to bore the BTC market into giving in... but the long term path is still up.

I know many disagree here, but I think we're rarely, if ever, going to see drawdowns of 30% or more in BTC... and I think the cycles will be way way more muted... but I think we'll see BTC 2-5x every 4 years moving forward until thing slowly move more and more into it replacing everything else...",1739389803.0,2

Plus, CLOB execution can screw over regular traders. If you’re seeing weird price action or giant trades happening that don’t match the vibe, it might be worth digging deeper.

Hey i don't know if this is the right place for this but im not finding to much help on google. So ima shot my shot... im trading and im doing fine but I could be doing a whole lot better. Ima trying hard to just blame myself. But when you constantly switch between assets and the same stuff happens on diffent charts it's hard not to assume this crap is rigged. 

At this point im just wasting money trying to prove this. I'm doing small trades and big ones(big relative to myself no more than a few thousand. I know traders will say I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm honestly starting to think These markets must rigged. It just has to be. Hear me out. I'm watching stocks/ crypto go up or down for days and just watch and watch to catch the price trends. Once I spot one I'll put in the long or short depending what it's doing. IMMEDIATELY after putting the long/short the market switches directions like someone is controlling it. I'll wait a while sometimes to see if it will reverse if it's not looking good I'll put in an order in the opposite direction while the other is still open. 

I kid you not the market immediately reverses again and then just stays in between my two positions lol. I'm not making this up. They could be 10 cents apart and it won't go to far in either direction. I did it multiple times to make sure. On diffent assets. Soon as I close the one the market will then go eliminate my open order like it knows. 🤣🤣. I don't wanna play the blame game just learn what's happening. 

I tried opening a long with a stop loss at diffent spots. No matter what the market began to move torward my stop loss and stop me out. So I tried putting a short in between my long and my stop to either force it back to my long or at the least it'll open the short if it goes to stop me it. No joke I'll sit in between them going sideways and eventually it'll go through the short and stop me out of the long and then go back up and stop me out the short🤣🤣🤣

I'm really not making this up. I know the dick answers will come but I'm genuinely trying learn this. If anyone has recommendations of somewhere I can go to watch someone explain this stuff correctly. Like I said I'm doing fine I'm not down but could be up way more if I understood why it seems like the market goes opposite whatever I do. According to Google many people experience  this and quit. Honestly I don't like it either when I hear market makers can ""hunt"" people. Doesn't seem like a fair playing field. But I'm trying not to give up. Any help or advice is welcomed.

1. Coins can only be sold once
2. Every seller has a buyer
3. Theres some significant buyers out there absorbing this (other than just the ETFs and MSTR)

When the rotation is complete and sellers are exhausted - we move up.

But here's the difference. Many of the buyers accumulating this cycle are going to be the type that never need to sell their assets. They hand them down through generations, borrow against them, or use them to offset their national debt.

The president and treasury secretary have outright told you the plan: We're going to grow our way out of debt. We know what this means: debasement.

Today I saw a ""feeler"" type of connection popping up for a few seconds and disappear again. Never saw that one before and asked perplexity:  

&gt; In Bitcoin Core's peer connection tab, when the ""type"" is listed as ""feeler,"" it means the connection is a short-lived test connection made to a random node from the local address manager (addrman) database. The purpose of a feeler connection is to check whether this peer is reachable and to gather limited information, without committing to a full, long-term peer connection. This helps the node maintain an up-to-date and healthy peer list while minimizing the risk of network partitioning or eclipse attacks. Feeler connections are typically quickly established and closed after a successful check.

Last week, the stock market completed a fully green week, but the gains were limited to around 0.5%. This week had some losing days, but they were still limited expect for Friday. The most important topic of 2025 came out again: Tariffs.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

September 12 close at 6,584.29 - September 19 close at 6,664.39 🟢 (+1.22%)

September 26 close at 6,643.70 - October 3 close at 6,715.79 🟢 (+1.09%)

October 3 close at 6,715.79 - October 10 close at 6,552.50 🔴 (-2.43%)

🔸 Monday: Trump said the stock market continually hit records highs. He's right. Many data releases were delayed or cancelled which helped the stock market. Volatility was lower. On the other hand, Gold and Silver continued to rise. The White House's Hassett said layoffs will come if Trump thinks shutdown negotiations 'are going nowhere'. The Dollar Index started rising from 97.5. The stock market opened higher. During the session, Trump announced all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported will be tariffed 25%. It was the first attempt for tariffs, but the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The Senate rejected Republican spending bill to end government shutdown. The stock market opened slightly higher. Precious metals have been very popular for a while and Goldman Sachs lifted its gold price target to $4,900 for 2026 year-end. The S&amp;P 500 declined from 6,750 and pulled back. The stock market closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 broken 7-day winning streak. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Gold rose above $4,000 for the first time in history. The stock market opened higher. Fed minutes were released and the stock market expects 2 more rate cut by the end of 2025. Next meeting will be October 29. CME FedWatch tool is showing 98% possibility of 25 point rate cut in October. The stock market closed higher. Nasdaq closed above 23,000 for the first time ever. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Silver gained more than 3.5% and surpassed $51. $49,81 was the highest since 2011. Thus, it surpassed. Israel and Hamas agreed on 'first phase' of Gaza ceasefire. The stock market opened higher. The Dollar Index continued rising and completed 4-day winning streak. It reached 99.50. As a result, Gold and Silver could not hold their gains. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but central bank needs to be ""cautious about it"". Gold and Silver rebounded after Thursday’s loses. The stock market opened higher. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 4.6% that slightly lower than last month's 4.7%, but it wasn't the focus for today because Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. Oil felt more than 4%. The stock market closed under heavy selling pressure. The S&amp;P 500 felt more than 2.5% and Nasdaq dropped more than 3.5%. 🔴

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another. I believe that we don't need to make any panic yet. We've seen this before.
