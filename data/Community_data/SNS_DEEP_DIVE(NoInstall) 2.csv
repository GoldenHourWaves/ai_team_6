https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qi6689/500m_liquidated_overnight_when_did_we_normalize/,Reddit,Post,reogin,"Woke up this morning, opened crypto Twitter — $500M+ liquidations overnight.

My reaction? “Oh. Another Tuesday.”  
And that scared me more than the number itself.

Back in October, that $19B liquidation day when BTC nuked from $126k felt apocalyptic. People were genuinely shaken. Now we see $300–500M liquidation events almost weekly and the timeline just… moves on.

Here's what bothers me: I've been liquidated twice this year. Not because my thesis was wrong or I overleveraged like an idiot. Both times, the exchange went ""under maintenance"" during the dump.

First time: Binance, March. BTC drops 12% in 8 minutes. I try to close my position → ""Error: system overload."" Try mobile app → same thing. Try to add margin → ""Deposits temporarily disabled."" Position liquidated at literally the worst tick. 23 minutes later, everything works fine.

Second time: Different CEX, similar story. Price crashes, platform freezes, liquidation goes through, platform unfreezes. $4.7k gone.

I'm not even mad anymore. I'm just numb to it. And that's the problem.

We've all collectively decided that:  
Exchanges going down during volatility = normal  
$500M erased in a few hours = just another day  
Getting liquidated due to ""technical issues"" = part of the game

When did this become acceptable?

I've been looking at non-custodial perps (Phantom, Trust Wallet, etc.) because at least if I get rekt, it's my own fault and not because some server conveniently crashed. Found Atomic Wallet's version lets you deposit via TRX-USDT – $0.50 fees instead of $15 on Ethereum. Small thing, but when you're paranoid about leaving funds on CEXs, it matters.

But here's my actual question:  
If you've been liquidated multiple times this year, why are you still trading perps?

I'm genuinely asking. Not judging, I'm still here too, somehow. But what's the thesis? Are we making money long-term, or just paying for the dopamine hit of 10x leverage while pretending it's ""strategy""?

Because from where I'm sitting, perps feel less like trading and more like betting against:  
Liquidation cascades you can't predict  
Stop-loss hunting algorithms  
Exchange outages that always happen during dumps (funny how that works)

Be honest with yourself: if leverage trading disappeared tomorrow, would you miss the strategy – or just the rush?

I don't have the answer. Maybe I'm being dramatic. Maybe this is just what trading looks like now and I need to adapt or leave.  
But I can't shake the feeling that we've all normalized something deeply broken.",1768927473.0,47

If the stock market drops, bitcoin will definitely drop initially ... but give it some time and wait for the actual bull run to start. The harder the market crashes, the more bitcoin will behave like gold.",1761844802.0,2

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ok2hxm/bitcoin_risks_2030_drop_as_crypto_markets/,Reddit,Comment,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant drop, revisiting the bottom of its local range near $107,000, as crypto markets saw $1.1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. This decline followed a 0.25% interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and uncertainty surrounding a potential US-China trade deal. Analysts warn of a potential 20-30% further drop in BTC prices, especially if stock markets face a correction. October 2025 marked a rare 'red' month for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency struggling to maintain its usual October gains.

Then I kept buying dips.. and now here we are.

I felt devastated in January 2025. The rest of 2025 has felt worse. And what's funny is before October 10th things felt dismal, then the liquidation event happened and the market is even more dismal than before.

Every few months since January of 2025 I didn't want to sell because my balance was so much lower than before. Then lower than before that. And then even lower than before that. And now everyone thinks it's going way lower.

I would have been much better off (comparatively speaking) to have sold everything Jan 2025. And hell, now, even selling it all early October 2025 before the liquidation event.

Now my bags are so incredibly negative, I just don't know what to do. Like the title says, selling in extreme fear feels so backwards and wrong. But nobody knows how much lower we are going.. even though we've already come so low. Not sure I can afford to hold through an entire bear market/crypto winter.

The easy part is to buy, so do it on the right time. The hardest part is to sell, especially if you need to cut losses. 

My tip to you is: There's no painless solution. Adjust your portfolio according to YOUR risk assessment. Sell what need to be sold and be prepared to whatever comes to the market. Forget how you will ""appear"" to the community. The 'community' won't be there for you when you need money for whatever it is that you are investing for.

\- IF this is the beginning of a bear (which is my guess) we are not going to see new ATH. Maybe a 'dead cat bounce' (much lower than previous highs) to then run to the bottom. How would you approach that?

The midterms next year are coming. The GOP are going to move heaven and earth to pump the markets to keep the wheels turning, ultimately taking possession of the levers at the fed. 

Interest rates will plummet and the printer will turned to 11. I'd say by eoQ2 that the mkt will WAY above ATH's, perhaps through to EOY.

Cashout stablecoins and then try repay the borrowed stablecoins as soon as possible (still risky, opens you up to liquidation still and depegging events can also mess you up, also smart contract risks as usual with crypto on-chain, if you were to do this please for the love of God keep the LTV as low as humanly possible and pay it off as quickly as you can)

Honestly I wouldn't recommend either. Both could lead to even more of a disaster, but it could be an option potentially.

I was in your shoes in 2017/2021, I decided to ""HODL"" because of bad advice on sites like these... and it was the worst decision ever. The bags kept getting heavier, the losses higher. Many alts never recovered, are basically dead now. I would rather have had 50% of my value (or whatever), than what it's worth now. Even after 2 cycles (8 years) with 2 new BTC ATHs, the once top alt coins  are now -90% or even more.

Alts are absolute SHIT to hodl. Why? Because every cycle brings a new artificial hype (NFT, Layer2, AI, etc...), and it wont be the same hype/topic in the next cycle, so most alts you buy now won't be relevant/hyped at all next cycle.

And even BTC... if you sell now, you can buy back in cheaper in the next year or so and you'll end up with more BTC than you have now.

I know it really, really hurts to sell at a loss, but the ""sunk cost fallacy"" is REAL. It's so psychologically blinding that it makes you make bad decisions. So let's say you bought .1 BTC for 10k and now its worth 7k. You don't want to sell, because you lose 3k. Well, the question is: would you buy that same .1 BTC right now for 7k (thinking it's a good or bad deal/time to buy)? If you wouldn't buy, then it means you should sell.

The decline followed a record liquidation event triggered by President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which caused Bitcoin to drop from $126,000 to near $104,800. Market uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and the Federal Reserve's resistance to further rate cuts contributed to the downturn. Despite the loss, Bitcoin remains up over 16% year-to-date.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gy95bs/this_current_bull_run_may_be_coming_to_an_end/,Reddit,Post,[deleted],"As the title states, I believe we are nearing the end of this bull run. Give or take 2-4 months, remaining.

Based on the patterns of previous bull runs and the current state of the cryptocurrency market, we can make some educated guesses from breaking down the previous runs.

Duration of Past Bull Markets:

2016–2017: This cycle lasted roughly 1.5 years. It began in early 2016 and ended in December 2017/January (early) 2018 when prices peaked.

2020–2021: The bull run in 2020–2021 lasted approximately 1.5 years as well, starting in March 2020 after the COVID-19 crash and ending in November 2021 when Bitcoin hit $68,000 - 69,000

Current Cycle (2023–2024/2025): If we are following a similar timeline, we could see a similar 1.5-year duration for this cycle, with the peak potentially occurring around late 2024 or early 2025.

All the bull runs begin to gain movement once the halving approaches and ends. 

Post-Halving Cycle: Historically, Bitcoin’s price tends to peak about 6 to 12 months after a halving, meaning we would see the strongest price increases from mid-2024 to early 2025. 

In conclusion, my opinion is this run could be ending in December or early 2025. I don't see BTC sky rocketing to 250k this cycle, as some have said. I don't even think 150k is possible. I think we get over that 100k hump, for sure....but the correction is going to be there.

We are already due for a  correction (as most crypto vets should be aware of) and I'd predict that in December.

This of course is my opinion, and is not financial advice.

I would like to see what everyone else has for an opinion on those matter. And yes I'm aware, no one really knows. But we can make educated guesses.",1732394064.0,42

Bull runs are correlated not just with the bitcoin halving but also with the US election cycle. A year of growth then peaks in late 2013, late 2017, late 2021, and next will likely be late 2025. Anomalous peaks and troughs are usually event-led and that's what is happening now. Trump won, Musk is head of DOGE and there's talk of a strategic btc reserve, so we have premature lift-off, which cannot be sustained for a year.

A crypto-friendly administration is going to give this longer runway.

- Naming the next head of the SEC. We all know Gensler is gone 1/20/25. Whoever his replacement is will probably be crypto-friendly and when the choice is made the market will go up.

- If the strategic Bitcoin reserve gains traction and becomes a thing, the market will go up.

- Legitimacy of Bitcoin and crypto in general is growing. Other companies I think will join the fray leading to more buy pressure. Increased legitimacy will lead to less unfavorable swings and price will start to level out.

Could definitely see $100-125K per Bitcoin with 1/20/25 getting closer and naming Gensler’s replacement. The market will pull back because people taking profit, maybe back down to $75K, but I believe Bitcoin will hold. We’re not going back down to $50K or less IMO, unless something absolutely catastrophic occurs.

I use the halving day as my starting point.  I would put the top somewhere between April-November 2025 if all else is equal.  As far as the halving cycle goes it would be early to say we are near the top.  We will certainly have some decent sized corrections over the next year or so but, at least on the time scale I am thinking, we won't enter a true bear market.

As far as your price predictions, which is &lt; 150k... I would say that, in a vacuum, 120-150k would be reasonable but with the other macro events going on I would be surprised if we didn't go over 150k.  

Anyways, we will see.  No hate for someone doing their own analysis that doesn't agree with my own.  If I could guarantee to be right 51% of the time I would be making a millions of dollars every day :)",1732486104.0,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1o6kjsz/btc_still_looks_strong_to_me_even_after_that/,Reddit,Post,Emotional-Fig-4105,"Been watching Bitcoin closely this week, and honestly, the price action looks way stronger than most people realize. BTC is sitting around $116K, and after that $19B liquidation flush, it bounced back almost immediately. Thats not weak price action, that’s real demand kicking in.

When I checked the onchain data, it showed something interesting, accumulation actually spiked during the dip around $109K. So while everyone was panicking, wallets with size were quietly stacking. That’s the kind of move I’ve seen before big pushes in past cycles.

Right now I’m eyeing the $110K–$108K range as a key zone to hold. If BTC keeps defending that area and volume starts picking up again, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a leg up soon. ETF flows are still positive, and institutional sentiment feels quietly bullish.

Feels like one of those times where the market looks shaky on the surface, but it’s just setting up for something bigger. Not financial advice, just what I’m seeing on my charts.

Bloomberg ran the headline today. Fourth annual loss. First one without a scandal attached.  No exchange collapsed. No founder arrested. No rug pull.  Just... boredom.

The tourists are checking out.  Here's what the tourists never understand: the boring parts are the feature, not the bug. Every technological shift follows the same arc. Ridicule. Resistance. Magazine cover. But between resistance and magazine cover? There's a long, quiet stretch where nothing seems to happen.

That's the dip.

The dip is where most people quit. Not because they failed—because they got tired of waiting.  I watched this happen in 2014. In 2018. In 2022. The headlines screamed death. The believers kept building. The difference between a tourist and a settler isn't conviction. It's tolerance for boredom.

Tourists need the dopamine of daily gains. Settlers understand that positioning happens in the quiet. The same information is available to everyone. The Fed's moves. The ETF flows. The macro headwinds. But information without the patience to act on it is just noise.

Risk isn't about volatility.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1povh2n/the_fatigue_filter/,Reddit,Comment,Budo00,"If someone's expressing Bitcoin fatigue—feeling burned out from the volatility, endless hype cycles, or the current dip—here are some empathetic, balanced things you could say, depending on the vibe. Right now (mid-December 2025), Bitcoin's hovering around $87,000–$90,000 after peaking over $126,000 in October, with low volumes and ETF outflows signaling widespread exhaustion. It's on track for a rare annual loss without a major scandal, just plain market weariness.
Empathetic and Neutral Responses
(If you want to validate their feelings without pushing):

""Yeah, I get it—the constant ups and downs are exhausting. It's been a wild ride this year, and right now everything feels stuck in neutral. Totally fair to tune out for a bit.""
""Bitcoin fatigue is real. We've seen these quiet, frustrating stretches before where nothing exciting happens. No shame in stepping back and focusing on other things.""

Encouraging for Long-Term Believers
(If they're open to a gentle nudge):

""These boring, sideways phases are actually the feature, not the bug. The hype brings in the crowds, but the quiet times filter out the tourists and let the network keep building. Hang in there if you believe in the fundamentals.""
""Zoom out: Even with this dip, Bitcoin's still up massively over multi-year cycles. Periods like this (low energy, fear in the air) have historically been when smart accumulation happens. Extreme fear often marks turning points.""
""Buy the dip? Only if it fits your plan—but yeah, weakness like this has preceded big moves up in past cycles. Patience is the hardest part.""

Light-Hearted or Meme-Inspired
(To keep it fun):

""Welcome to the fatigue filter. The ones who stick around through the boredom are the ones who win long-term.""
""HODL through the snooze fest. We're all gonna make it (WAGMI)... eventually.""

If They're Really Over It

""No worries if you're done—crypto isn't for everyone, especially when it's dragging like this. Plenty of other ways to invest or just live life without checking charts every day.""

The key is empathy first. Bitcoin's history is full of these lulls (2014–2016, 2018–2020, 2022), and they've always ended with new highs eventually. But forcing optimism on someone who's tapped out rarely helps. Listen more than you talk.",1765983644.0,0

The fact that the price isn’t pumping they say is due to manipulation of the market but the sceptic in me thinks that using manipulation as a scapegoat for why the price isn’t going up is an easy way to create a boogie man that most people can’t prove.

I know that obviously the Blockchain is public but if it was that easy to just spot the manipulation going on surely everyone would know and it wouldn’t work.. 

So my question is and bearing in mind I am relatively new to crypto (2/3yr lurker) are there other ways to prove this market manipulation and answer the question of whether or not it’s happening and therefore gain more accurate view of the value of bitcoin and crypto. 

Or am I just asking to predict the future..

They can print stock, for example, by borrowing it and selling it onto the market to prevent it from going up (shorting)... but this can't be done with BTC (only derivatives of BTC, like ETFs...). That's a deeper topic, but needless to say, derivative stuff doesn't stop exchanges from managing real supply/demand

What they can do is actually the opposite. And I'm seeing signs of it on the blockchain. They can prevent a finite thing from going down quite easily. They also have an incentive to do this now that billionaires and corporations are buying BTC with no intent to sell. As a simple high level explanation of this, imagine an entity like Black Rock 'borrowing' (through bonds or other constructs; leveraging debt) billions to buy BTC at floor point and prevent it from falling. They can do this...

So while they can set off flash crashes when there is illiquidity in markets (it might only take 1,000 BTC sold to fill the order book and give the impression of panic selling)... it doesn't work when a floor has been established in that illiquid market and others are waiting for this behavior to buy... we've been seeing that at $92k...

So, my feeling is that institutions, and large players are creating the velocity upwards when they can leverage to benefit most from it... then they stop the price in a range (like what we've seen 92-108k..) they are using micro manipulation within this range to shake people (fomo in when it looks like ATH is testing) and flash crashes to $92 that buy back up fast). The reason they do this... is because if they can use just 1,000 to set offf some panic from $105k, and get the price to run down to $94k fast... they can buy those 1,000 and some more as it approaches those zone where heavy buying is waiting... so they can sell 1,000 and buy back 1,500 for example... they've been doing this the last few months... 

Eventually when they aren't able to make BTC doing this (eventually the panic will stop to the point that no one sells when we see a drop from 99k to 92k ... then they will let this run up to the next zone... and they'll repeat. I suspect we're done with cycles in BTC. I think in the long run we're still going to see 30% or more gains per year, but we'll get these 3-6 month long drawn out sideways events. This is how institutions who have time on their side and want to just buy and get as much as they can operate. They will try to bore the BTC market into giving in... but the long term path is still up.

I know many disagree here, but I think we're rarely, if ever, going to see drawdowns of 30% or more in BTC... and I think the cycles will be way way more muted... but I think we'll see BTC 2-5x every 4 years moving forward until thing slowly move more and more into it replacing everything else...",1739389803.0,2

Plus, CLOB execution can screw over regular traders. If you’re seeing weird price action or giant trades happening that don’t match the vibe, it might be worth digging deeper.

Hey i don't know if this is the right place for this but im not finding to much help on google. So ima shot my shot... im trading and im doing fine but I could be doing a whole lot better. Ima trying hard to just blame myself. But when you constantly switch between assets and the same stuff happens on diffent charts it's hard not to assume this crap is rigged. 

At this point im just wasting money trying to prove this. I'm doing small trades and big ones(big relative to myself no more than a few thousand. I know traders will say I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm honestly starting to think These markets must rigged. It just has to be. Hear me out. I'm watching stocks/ crypto go up or down for days and just watch and watch to catch the price trends. Once I spot one I'll put in the long or short depending what it's doing. IMMEDIATELY after putting the long/short the market switches directions like someone is controlling it. I'll wait a while sometimes to see if it will reverse if it's not looking good I'll put in an order in the opposite direction while the other is still open. 

I kid you not the market immediately reverses again and then just stays in between my two positions lol. I'm not making this up. They could be 10 cents apart and it won't go to far in either direction. I did it multiple times to make sure. On diffent assets. Soon as I close the one the market will then go eliminate my open order like it knows. 🤣🤣. I don't wanna play the blame game just learn what's happening. 

I tried opening a long with a stop loss at diffent spots. No matter what the market began to move torward my stop loss and stop me out. So I tried putting a short in between my long and my stop to either force it back to my long or at the least it'll open the short if it goes to stop me it. No joke I'll sit in between them going sideways and eventually it'll go through the short and stop me out of the long and then go back up and stop me out the short🤣🤣🤣

I'm really not making this up. I know the dick answers will come but I'm genuinely trying learn this. If anyone has recommendations of somewhere I can go to watch someone explain this stuff correctly. Like I said I'm doing fine I'm not down but could be up way more if I understood why it seems like the market goes opposite whatever I do. According to Google many people experience  this and quit. Honestly I don't like it either when I hear market makers can ""hunt"" people. Doesn't seem like a fair playing field. But I'm trying not to give up. Any help or advice is welcomed.

1. Coins can only be sold once
2. Every seller has a buyer
3. Theres some significant buyers out there absorbing this (other than just the ETFs and MSTR)

When the rotation is complete and sellers are exhausted - we move up.

But here's the difference. Many of the buyers accumulating this cycle are going to be the type that never need to sell their assets. They hand them down through generations, borrow against them, or use them to offset their national debt.

The president and treasury secretary have outright told you the plan: We're going to grow our way out of debt. We know what this means: debasement.

Today I saw a ""feeler"" type of connection popping up for a few seconds and disappear again. Never saw that one before and asked perplexity:  

&gt; In Bitcoin Core's peer connection tab, when the ""type"" is listed as ""feeler,"" it means the connection is a short-lived test connection made to a random node from the local address manager (addrman) database. The purpose of a feeler connection is to check whether this peer is reachable and to gather limited information, without committing to a full, long-term peer connection. This helps the node maintain an up-to-date and healthy peer list while minimizing the risk of network partitioning or eclipse attacks. Feeler connections are typically quickly established and closed after a successful check.

Last week, the stock market completed a fully green week, but the gains were limited to around 0.5%. This week had some losing days, but they were still limited expect for Friday. The most important topic of 2025 came out again: Tariffs.

📊 Here are the S&amp;P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

September 12 close at 6,584.29 - September 19 close at 6,664.39 🟢 (+1.22%)

September 19 close at 6,664.39 - September 26 close at 6,643.70 🔴 (-0.31%)

September 26 close at 6,643.70 - October 3 close at 6,715.79 🟢 (+1.09%)

October 3 close at 6,715.79 - October 10 close at 6,552.50 🔴 (-2.43%)

🔸 Monday: Trump said the stock market continually hit records highs. He's right. Many data releases were delayed or cancelled which helped the stock market. Volatility was lower. On the other hand, Gold and Silver continued to rise. The White House's Hassett said layoffs will come if Trump thinks shutdown negotiations 'are going nowhere'. The Dollar Index started rising from 97.5. The stock market opened higher. During the session, Trump announced all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported will be tariffed 25%. It was the first attempt for tariffs, but the stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The Senate rejected Republican spending bill to end government shutdown. The stock market opened slightly higher. Precious metals have been very popular for a while and Goldman Sachs lifted its gold price target to $4,900 for 2026 year-end. The S&amp;P 500 declined from 6,750 and pulled back. The stock market closed lower. The S&amp;P 500 broken 7-day winning streak. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Gold rose above $4,000 for the first time in history. The stock market opened higher. Fed minutes were released and the stock market expects 2 more rate cut by the end of 2025. Next meeting will be October 29. CME FedWatch tool is showing 98% possibility of 25 point rate cut in October. The stock market closed higher. Nasdaq closed above 23,000 for the first time ever. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Silver gained more than 3.5% and surpassed $51. $49,81 was the highest since 2011. Thus, it surpassed. Israel and Hamas agreed on 'first phase' of Gaza ceasefire. The stock market opened higher. The Dollar Index continued rising and completed 4-day winning streak. It reached 99.50. As a result, Gold and Silver could not hold their gains. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but central bank needs to be ""cautious about it"". Gold and Silver rebounded after Thursday’s loses. The stock market opened higher. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations preliminary came at 4.6% that slightly lower than last month's 4.7%, but it wasn't the focus for today because Trump warned of new ""massive"" tariffs on China. Oil felt more than 4%. The stock market closed under heavy selling pressure. The S&amp;P 500 felt more than 2.5% and Nasdaq dropped more than 3.5%. 🔴

The stock market continued to rise slowly while the government remaining closed. We did not see any labor market data, so the stock market could not get information from reports. The S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2.5% in a single day, but volume was only slightly above 20-day moving average. The stock market had made all-time high after another. I believe that we don't need to make any panic yet. We've seen this before.

It started like any other volatile Friday in crypto red charts, restless traders, and the hum of speculation rolling through Telegram rooms. By nightfall, though, it had transformed into the largest liquidation event in the history of digital assets. Over $19 billion in leveraged positions vanished within hours, wiping out portfolios, shaking confidence, and forcing even the most seasoned investors to sit in stunned silence. And yet, if history is any guide, this wasn’t an ending. It was a reset. Late Friday afternoon, a familiar name reappeared in the financial crosshairs Donald Trump.

https://medium.com/nolusprotocol/liquidation-impacts-17163b01e7de,Web,Article,Nolus Protocol,"Nolus delivers a novel primitive to DeFi through an asset-backed margin product that prioritizes predictability and risk control. With fixed rates, structured liquidity, and controlled leverage, the protocol transforms how users engage with crypto markets The catalyst came late on October 10, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, triggering panic across global markets. With traditional financial markets closed for the weekend, the 24/7 crypto ecosystem bore the entire shock. The event exposed a key vulnerability: hidden leverage. Aggregate open interest was near all-time highs going into the weekend, meaning even a modest macro shock cascaded into a violent chain of automated liquidations. This was not an isolated dip but a system-wide stress test that revealed how different DeFi and CeFi platforms manage risk under extreme volatility. Liquidation Intensity represents the total liquidation power of an event, meaning the value of liquidations relative to a protocol’s total active portfolio value. This metric normalizes liquidation impact across different market models, providing a cleaner comparison of systemic pressure. Overcollateralized lenders such as Aave and Kamino barely flinched. Aave saw only 0.9% of its $21.5B loan book liquidated (around $190M), and Kamino reported about 1.1% ($20M on a $1.8B portfolio). Their conservative loan-to-value ratios and excess collateral buffers acted as natural shock absorbers. By contrast, perpetual markets endured the most severe stress. Hyperliquid, one of the largest on-chain perpetual exchanges, recorded roughly $12.8B in liquidations over the 24-hour window against about $13.8B in open interest prior to the crash. At first glance, that implies an extreme 90% liquidation-to-open-interest ratio, but this interpretation misses a key dynamic: open interest is constantly replenished. As older positions were forcibly closed, new ones were opened in rapid succession during the volatility spike. Post-event, Hyperliquid’s open interest stabilized near $6.4B, showing not a collapse but a massive churn and rebalancing of leverage within its ecosystem. Other decentralized perp venues like dYdX also experienced elevated stress, with about 14% of its $168M open interest liquidated. Significant, but far more contained. In comparison, Nolus recorded $275K in liquidations out of $2.61M in active margin loans equating to 10.5% liquidation intensity. This represents a controlled deleveraging process rather than the cascading wipeouts seen in high-leverage environments. While liquidation intensity measures pressure, Portfolio Reduction shows how much total exposure a protocol lost from before to after the crash, through both liquidations and voluntary closures. This underscores Nolus’s resilience and measured risk calibration: higher leverage than lenders, but with a much softer landing than perpetual exchanges. To quantify how efficiently protocols managed deleveraging, we define the Liquidation Efficiency Ratio (LER) Nolus’s ratio highlights its ability to contain volatility with limited collateral destruction, confirming that its liquidation thresholds and price protection mechanisms are well-calibrated. Beyond the metrics, three design features enabled Nolus to maintain composure during the crash: Together, these mechanisms created a multi-layered defense system minimizing liquidation power, filtering short-lived volatility, and ensuring users’ capital was protected even during systemic shocks. The October 10, 2025 flash crash was more than a market panic. It was a once-in-a-cycle stress test for every leverage architecture in crypto. With no bad debt, contained liquidation power, and advanced safeguards like EMA-based smoothing and Market Anomaly Guard (MAG), Nolus proved that leverage can be efficient without being reckless. As markets recalibrate post-crash, Nolus emerges validated, not for avoiding volatility, but for mastering how to navigate it intelligently.

https://medium.com/thecapital/the-truth-about-the-current-crypto-market-08b018a34cc6,Web,Article,Ben Fairbank,"Educating and empowering readers on all things crypto and blockchain. For business inquiries: business@thecapital.io We ALL got this market wildly wrong and I will be the first to admit that I didn’t see it playing out this way either. I honestly assumed that by this time we would have been at the end or nearing the end of a wild bull run, and it hasn’t even started yet. In late summer 2025 (US summer), seasoned analysts and Wall Street banks were calling for a new crypto ‘Moonvember’. Forecasts from Golman Sachs and JPMorgan suggested bitcoin could surge past $220K USD and even up around the $250K mark. Fundstrat’s models pointed higer still. Instead the market suffered a brutal reversal, with Bitcoin falling around 30% from its October 6 peak of $126K USD to around $84K USD within 6 weeks. If you feel blindsided or that this was some form of witchcraft, you’re not alone. The collective misread of this cycle is the first lesson of todays story. 2025 has been a year of wtf just happened crises after crises. Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, the US and China rivalry and turmoil in Sudan weigh on sentiment. On top of that, some monetary skullduggery and debauchery has played out across the blue marble: This swirling macro backdrop undermines simple ‘up only’ narratives. When policymakers oscillate between stimulus and austerity, and geopolitical tensions cut across supply chains, crypto behaves less like digital gold and more like a high‑beta macro asset. Which won’t please all the crypto bros who are just here for the tech. The October 10 flash‑crash was the single most important event of this cycle. On that day, triggered partly by Trump’s tariff bombshell, and nothing at all in any way shape or form, anything to do with Binance, more than US $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin fell nearly 10% intraday and briefly dipped below $110K USD, while many alt‑coins plunged 30–60%. 1.6 million traders were affected and yet nobody wants to really speak about it. It’s been a ‘nothing to see here, move along’ type of event that is just as shocking as any major global attack or catastrophic event that would have been rigorously investigated and people brought to justice. Analysis of the order books shows that the real carnage was mechanical. Amberdata’s forensic report found that 70% of the liquidation damage happened in just 40 minutes, with a 9.89 billion‑dollar deleveraging compressed into an algorithmic cascade. During the peak minute, $3.21 billion USD vanished in 60 seconds, and more than 93% of those orders were forced selling. Open interest collapsed by $36.7 billion USD, order‑book liquidity evaporated by 98%, and bid‑ask spreads exploded 321×. In other words, macro headlines lit the fuse, but leverage was the bomb. Crypto’s growth has brought sophisticated products like perpetual futures, on‑chain leverage protocols, high‑frequency bots. These tools amplify both gains and losses. The Great Crypto Crash report observed that long positions worth $17 billion USD were liquidated when stop‑loss levels were triggered. Even after the wash‑out, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of around $3 billion USD in November. On decentralised exchange HyperLiquid, margin traders often use 10× to 50× leverage, and within one 24‑hour window roughly $2 billion USD of positions were liquidated. So you can blame the people who caused it all you like, but it couldn’t have happened if there wasn’t so much leveraged. High leverage shortens market memory and price moves become spiky rather than trending. Order books thin out, and algorithmic liquidations cascade faster than humans can react. The clean, euphoric rallies of past cycles are replaced by sharp squeezes and violent flushes. Long‑only investors expecting a blow‑off top may never see it, not because adoption has stalled but because the market structure has changed, or so it would appear. For veterans of crypto’s previous four‑year cycles, the lack of a traditional blow‑off top is disorienting. Past halving cycles saw bitcoin peak roughly 12–18 months after the block‑reward halving. In April 2024, bitcoin’s reward fell again, by October 6, 2025 the price had peaked after roughly 17.5 months, fitting the historical timeline. Yet instead of a parabolic melt‑up, the rally stalled amid the macro storms. The 50‑week moving average soon rolled over like a dog performing for biscuits, convincing many that the bear market had started. The reality is more of a cluster you-know-what. Bitcoin is now 13% below its January 1 value, underperforming both gold and tech stocks, like when does that happen?. But the halving cycle is not broken, I think, it is being stretched and distorted by exogenous shocks, such as tariffs, liquidity drains, rate divergences, AI boom or bust cycles. In the past, the halving’s impact has often reasserted itself once macro headwinds subside. It is tempting to view the crash as a repudiation of crypto. Yet beneath the price volatility, 2025 delivered more structural progress than any year in crypto’s history, think about that for a moment. Pantera Capital counts a long list of achievements, such as a pro‑crypto administration, the rescission of SEC SAB 121, the signing of stablecoin legislation, the inclusion of Coinbase in the S&P 500 and the IPOs of several blockchain firms. On‑chain value of real‑world assets increased 235% and stablecoins added $100 billion USD. Banks can now custody crypto assets off‑balance‑sheet, thanks to regulatory clarity. Tokenisation is poised to drive the next adoption wave. Forbes predicts that 2026 will “belong to tokenized real‑world assets” tokenised funds, treasuries and other instruments that solve real problems such as settlement delays and capital inefficiency. Tokenisation reframes crypto from being a speculative asset class into a new way of representing ownership, shifting activity from trading to infrastructure. In 2026, regulatory changes such as the GENIUS Act and plans for a state‑backed stable token will further encourage institutional participation. Seen through this lens, the pullback is less an abandonment than a final repricing before a more mature phase. Investors are shifting from meme tokens to tokenised treasuries, on‑chain invoices and real‑world assets. Liquidity drained by QT and leverage unwinds may soon return once the Fed stops shrinking its balance sheet. Politics always bleed into markets, and the upcoming 2026 U.S. midterm elections are no exception, and I personally think this is the Plan A for Trump. Axios reports that President Trump and his advisers have near‑religious faith that the economy will “take off like a rocket ship” in early 2026. The optimism is rooted in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed in July 2025, which extended 2017 tax cuts and introduced new write‑offs for tip earners, overtime workers and parents. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects a refund boom, workers could see tax refunds of up to $2 000 USD that many will treat like casino chips, and businesses can write off capital expenditures. These measures are expected to boost consumption and investment. Market strategists expect stocks, especially AI and energy companies, to rally into the midterms. However, Trump’s protectionist tariffs simultaneously drive up consumer prices and fuel inflation. Data from AInvest warns that the effective tariff rate surged to 18% in 2025, sparking a 17% global market sell‑off and a 14 % drop in Australian shares. Midterm years historically experience an average 17% drawdown in U.S. equities due to political uncertainty. Investors hoping for a pre‑midterm bull run should recognise that the same policies meant to juice growth, tax cuts and deregulation, also carry inflationary and fiscal risks. The market could rip higher on optimism or recoil if inflation flares. We have 2 fat guys on a see-saw at the moment and its a matter of which one is fatter. As we move into 2026, two forces may decide crypto’s fate, employment trends and liquidity policy. The weak November jobs report underscores a slowing U.S. economy. In response, the Fed cut rates and paused QT. Analysts expect QT to end completely by early 2026, which would expand bank reserves and support risk assets. Past cycles show that bitcoin rallies when the Fed moves from tightening to neutral or easing. So there is that. At the same time, the December rate cut did little for bitcoin’s price,it in actuality did sweet didley squat, the coin drifted around $92 000–$94 000 USD despite a dovish Fed. This tepid reaction reveals that liquidity constraints and ETF outflows still weigh on the market, and if we want to be real here, the market we see isn’t behaving like the one we don’t see. Investors are waiting for clarity, on inflation, wages and the Fed’s next move. That is the “pregnant pause” we find ourselves in now, to use a familiar Australian term. No one truly knows. If they did, they wouldn’t have missed the October crash, or would have they?. But we can distil a few lessons: Crypto remains a nascent, rapidly evolving experiment. To navigate it now, we must balance data with conviction, macro awareness with technological optimism. Sometimes, the most honest stance is to admit we misread the present while still believing in a transformative future. Or we can just rub rabbits feet until we go up only.

https://medium.com/@Lastadam/the-october-2025-stress-test-what-really-happened-when-crypto-infrastructure-failed-518550a58ad8,Web,Article,@Lastadam,"October 2025 gave us the ultimate stress test. Not one, but TWO black swan events hit crypto within 10 days: Let’s talk about what this means for real decentralization. On October 10, 2025, Trump tweets (sorry, “Truths”) about 100% tariffs on Chinese tech. Markets panic. Crypto bleeds. Here’s where it gets interesting. Between Oct 6–14, Binance was transitioning from spot-based to oracle-based pricing for margin. During this window: Classic case of infrastructure vulnerability creating systematic risk. AWS US-EAST-1 (Northern Virginia) experiences DNS resolution failures. DynamoDB and EC2 services fail. Duration: 16 hours. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: L2s maintained perfect consensus during the outage. Sequencers were ordering transactions, blocks were being produced, everything was “working.” But users couldn’t access any of it. Cryptographically decentralized, operationally centralized. The worst of both worlds. Let’s be specific about what “zero impact” means: This wasn’t luck. This was architecture. No opinions. Just what happened. If you’re building on L2s, ask yourself: If they can’t answer these, they’re not actually decentralized. 37% of Ethereum nodes on AWS. That’s 2,371 out of 6,408 nodes. Good news: Not enough to halt the chain. Bad news: Enough to severely impact user access. Verdict: Protocol is decentralized, access layer has systematic risk. Technically: No, they have cryptographic proofs and settlement to L1. Practically: If AWS goes down and nobody can use them, does it matter? Quote from Jay Jog (Sei Labs): “Base going down when AWS goes down is literally the entire argument in favour of EVM L1s like Sei.” Problem: The internet itself runs on centralized infrastructure. Reality: AWS holds ~30% of global cloud market. Question: Can decentralized apps exist on centralized internet? None are perfect. All are necessary. 1. Protocol Decentralization ≠ Operational Decentralization You can have perfect consensus and zero user access. L2s proved this definitively. Any network claiming decentralization must prove it can survive major cloud provider failures. 3. Solana’s Redemption Arc is Complete After years of criticism for outages, Solana had zero issues during both crash and AWS failure. That’s not luck, that’s infrastructure investment paying off. 4. Infrastructure Diversity Costs Money Multi-cloud is expensive. Independent hosting requires expertise. But the alternative is: what happened to L2s on October 20. 5. Users Don’t Care About Technical Decentralization They care about: Can I access my funds? Can I make transactions? Is the network available? If the answer is “no” because AWS is down, your decentralization narrative is worthless. Post-crisis stablecoin market cap on Solana: Why this matters: Stablecoins flow to reliable infrastructure. When institutions need to park capital, they choose networks they trust to be available. Post-outage developer activity: October 2025 taught us that availability is decentralization. If your users can’t access your network during a cloud outage, you’re not decentralized. You’re just a database with extra steps. Solana proved you can have both performance and resilience. Bitcoin proved you can be completely independent. Ethereum proved you need at least 63% non-AWS validators to survive. L2s proved they have work to do. The networks that learn from this will survive. The ones that don’t, won’t. What Raj Gokal would say (probably): “We spent years getting shit for outages. We fixed them. We distributed infrastructure. We proved it works. The data is public. Everything else is noise.” And honestly? The data backs him up. Disclaimer: This analysis is based on publicly available data as of October 2025. Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. This is not financial advice. Do your own research. Don’t trust, verify. But seriously, verify your infrastructure dependencies. October 2025 showed us why it matters.

https://medium.com/@Flavoured/surviving-the-worst-crash-in-crypto-history-october-10-2025-f1f6a78528e5,Web,Article,@Flavoured,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BM6amJLQh4 ~17 minutes (approx., based on transcript provided) Tools, Websites, or Apps Mentioned The video argues that the 10–11 October 2025 sell-off was the most violent deleveraging in crypto’s history, triggered minutes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, igniting a liquidity air-pocket across major venues. External coverage corroborates a record liquidation cascade of ~US$19–19.5B in 24 hours, with multiple outlets attributing the spark to Trump’s tariff move and thin weekend books. (The Week) Scale and mechanics of the crash.Order books thinned rapidly, perps funding flipped, and automated liquidation engines chased price down as over-levered longs unwound. Independent reporting places total market liquidations near US$19–19.5B, making it the largest single-day wipeout on record, with Hyperliquid alone seeing outsized on-chain liquidations and losses by thousands of wallets. The “why” was not just the headline — excess leverage + weekend liquidity amplified every tick into forced selling. (CoinDesk) Comparison with past crises.The creator contrasts this event with FTX (Nov 2022) and COVID/March 2020. The key claim is that this was an external shock stress-testing market structure rather than a plumbing failure (as with FTX). Contemporary analysis broadly agrees it set a new high-water mark for liquidation volume, even compared with 2020 and 2022 episodes. Resilience was stronger this time: no major insolvencies or prolonged withdrawals emerged in the immediate aftermath; spot and DeFi rails continued functioning. (Caveat: “largest ever” varies a little by methodology and source.) (CoinDesk) CEX vs DEX performance and the transparency debate.The video highlights Hyperliquid as a standout for uptime and on-chain verifiability during the panic, and names OKXamong CEXs that remained stable. Separate media coverage reinforces Hyperliquid’s unusually large liquidation footprint and market-share growth in 2025, while also noting the industry debate that followed: did some CEXs under-report liquidations during the spike? Hyperliquid co-founder Jeff Yan publicly alleged certain CEXs under-reported by up to 100× due to per-second event limits; CoinGlass has separately warned of frequency-cap artefacts in published numbers. These are contested claims (Binance disputes them); regardless, the incident has pushed “proof-of-events” (verifiable, time-stamped liquidation data) onto the agenda alongside proof-of-reserves. (CoinDesk) Alts as aftershocks.The creator’s account that some altcoins briefly wicked catastrophically due to thin liquidity + high leverage is consistent with how weekend order books and perps mechanics behave under stress. External write-ups also describe unusually deep alt drawdowns during the Oct 10–11 window before sharp mean-reversion for stronger names. (Exact per-token percentages vary by venue; wick extremes on single exchanges can be idiosyncratic and shouldn’t be over-generalised.) Institutions vs retail — process beats emotion.A core theme is asymmetry: institutions ran hedges, dry powder, and disciplined leverage, while many retail accounts ran 10–50× long and got caught in the cascade. That’s in line with post-mortems after prior shocks: sophisticated players use pre-defined risk systems and cross-venue optionality, while retail often relies on the venue’s protections — which can lag in fast tapes. Practical takeaways (operational, not hype): Where the video may over-reach or needs nuance: Bottom line.The episode was a textbook liquidity shock: an exogenous headline hit a market loaded with leverage during a thin-liquidity window. What followed was a forced-seller spiral, then a swift re-equilibration. Structural resilience has improved since 2022 (DeFi rails, on-chain perps), but human factors — overconfidence, leverage drift, single-venue dependence — remain the weak links. The creator’s closing advice is pragmatic: guardrails, liquidity buffers, venue diversity, and a bias toward preparation over prediction. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #Liquidations #Perps #DeFi #RiskManagement #Trading #Hyperliquid #Binance #OKX #MarketStructure #Tariffs ⚠️ Disclaimer:This article is only presented for educational and entertainment purposes.

https://dewhales.substack.com/p/major-exploits-of-2025,Web,Article,Dewhales Research,"IntroductionExchange & private key compromisesSmart contract exploitsSocial engineering on the riseThe October 10 crashNotable mentions of 2025What we can learnReferences ​​The crypto ecosystem lost $3.4 billion in 2025, roughly flat with 2024’s $3.38 billion. But the numbers hide a shift in how theft happens. North Korean state actors dominated the year, and the gap between the largest exploits and typical incidents hit record extremes. The pattern is clear. Attacks are getting more concentrated, more sophisticated, and increasingly focused on supply chains and human vulnerabilities rather than brute-forcing smart contracts. Audits and multisig wallets aren’t enough anymore. In one of 2025’s most significant breaches, Bybit lost between $1.4 and $1.5 billion in February after a targeted supply chain attack. Critically, the breach did not start inside Bybit’s own matching engine or custody stack. North Korea’s TraderTraitor group compromised a Safe wallet system administrator and injected malicious code directly into the UI. The code spoofed legitimate multisig transactions, swapping the destination address at the final approval moment. During a routine cold-to-warm wallet transfer, the attackers drained 401,000 ETH. The FBI attributed the breach to DPRK within five days. Funds scattered across thousands of addresses through DEXs, bridges, and no-KYC swaps. The laundering pattern differed from typical operations. 60% of transfers stayed under $500,000, cycling through Chinese-language services on a 45-day rhythm. Most actors move funds in $1 million to $10 million tranches. Private key compromises drove 88% of Q1 losses despite enterprise security measures. North Korean operatives have been embedding themselves as IT contractors inside crypto companies, gaining privileged access for both immediate theft and long-term reconnaissance. Trust Wallet’s browser extension became the latest supply chain compromise. The attack affected $7 million in user funds, which Trust Wallet covered in full. Users with version 2.68 were instructed to disable the extension and upgrade to version 2.69. Mobile users and other browser extension versions were not impacted. Trust Wallet is investigating how attackers were able to submit the compromised version. An integer overflow in Move’s checked_shlw function let an attacker manipulate how Cetus calculated liquidity. Using flash loans and a tight tick range between 300,000 and 300,200, they created fake tokens like BULLA and MOJO that appeared massively over-collateralized from just a single token deposit. The flaw assigned these worthless tokens huge liquidity values, draining 46 pools in under fifteen minutes. Sui validators froze $162 million through consensus-based transaction censorship, but over $60 million had already moved to Ethereum via cross-chain bridges. Balancer V2 had two problems. First, weak access control in the manageUserBalance function allowed attackers to spoof op.sender. Second, a rounding bug in _upscaleArray created precision loss during calculations. The attacker chained 65 tiny swaps together, compounding the rounding error to suppress token prices by 10%, then extracted value through arbitrage. The damage spread across multiple chains. Ethereum took $99 million in losses. Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism, and Berachain all got hit. More than twenty Balancer forks inherited the same vulnerability. Both protocols had been audited multiple times. The audits missed novel attack vectors anyway. Balancer’s unified V2 codebase made it worse. One bug spread to every deployment and fork, turning a single oversight into a chain-wide failure. While attackers exploited protocol-level vulnerabilities, the market’s own infrastructure became the next critical failure point. North Korean operations moved beyond basic email phishing. Attackers now impersonate executives and investors, embedding fake IT workers inside crypto companies to maintain long-term access. They also compromise legitimate accounts, contacting victims from verified profiles they’ve hijacked. These operatives combine insider knowledge with technical reconnaissance, setting up both immediate theft and future infrastructure compromises. AI accelerated the problem. Automated systems scan public repositories and codebases to craft targeted phishing campaigns, then replicate exploits across chains within hours. Fake Coinbase support calls alone stole over $100 million. Infrastructure exploits tied to social engineering averaged $30 million each, with 80% gaining entry through compromised hot wallet credentials. Personal wallets now represent roughly 44% of total crypto theft, up from 7% in 2022. The shift reflects a move toward automation. Instead of hunting whales, attackers run scaled operations hitting smaller amounts across thousands of victims. That said, whales aren’t spared. On December 19th, one whale lost $50 million in an address poisoning scam. What used to require deep technical skill now runs on systematized trust exploitation. October 10 became the largest liquidation event in crypto history. $19.3 billion vanished in under 14 hours. $3.21 billion disappeared in the first 60 seconds alone. 1.6 million traders got wiped out. Two triggers hit within sixteen minutes of each other. Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. MSCI released a consultation on excluding Digital Asset Treasuries from its global indices. Markets had no time to absorb either shock. Liquidity collapsed in three dimensions. Order book depth fell 85%. BTC spreads exploded from 0.02 basis points to 26.43, a 1,321x increase. Exchanges fragmented. Binance quoted 2.50 bps while Arkham showed 13.14 bps. There was no unified market anymore. The most extreme dislocation concentrated on Binance, where internal order book liquidity for USDe and related collateral vanished. Binance prices crashed while other exchanges traded normally. What started as a Binance-specific problem triggered liquidations across the entire market. Oracle manipulation turned a $60 million sell-off into a $9.6 billion cascade. Recursive USDe leverage lets traders stack 10x positions on top of manipulatable internal spot prices. The math compounded until it broke. The deleveraging wiped $65 billion in open interest. Market makers lost hundreds of millions. Even well-capitalized firms weren’t immune to the cascade. Weekend liquidity gaps made it worse. Binance’s API froze for both retail traders and market makers, and parts of the UI stopped working. Traders couldn’t buy the dip or add collateral even if they wanted to. The worst stablecoin depegs happened on Binance, where USDe and wrapped collateral markets crashed below par while trading near peg on other exchanges and on-chain. A Binance-specific problem looked like system-wide failure. Binance ultimately paid $283 million in compensation to stabilize things while other major exchanges kept functioning normally. While the Bybit breach and the October crash dominated headlines, the following incidents illustrate the technical shift toward infrastructure manipulation and sophisticated social engineering that defined the year. Phemex (CEX) – $73M (January): A cross-chain hot-wallet compromise affecting 16 different blockchains. Forensic analysis linked this attack to North Korean clusters, suggesting a coordinated campaign of gaining entry through compromised hot wallet credentials. UPCX (Web3 Payments) – $70M (April 1): Attackers gained access to an owner account via a private key exploit. They then performed a malicious upgrade to the implementation logic, adding a function that allowed them to “sweep” 18.4 million UPC tokens directly from management accounts. Bitget – $100M (April 20): A market infrastructure failure rather than a direct hack. A malfunctioning automated market-maker bot flooded the market with erratic, predictable orders. Savvy traders identified the pattern and siphoned $100M before the platform could freeze accounts and reverse trades. The industry solved one problem while another grew worse. Years of work perfecting smart contract audits made code exploits harder, but attackers adapted. Bybit fell to a supply chain compromise. The October crash exposed exchange-level infrastructure gaps, especially where one venue concentrated the bulk of leveraged flow. Meanwhile, Cetus and Balancer proved that novel code exploits still work even after multiple audits. Safe wallet had no formal relationship with Bybit. It was external infrastructure that became the point of failure. One compromised admin account enabled $1.5 billion in theft. North Korean operatives spend months embedded as IT contractors, gaining access no audit prevents. The October crash exposed similar infrastructure weakness. Binance’s liquidity vanished and its API froze while other exchanges functioned normally. Both Cetus and Balancer passed multiple audits before getting drained through vectors the reviews never considered. The pattern isn’t that code is secure now. It’s that attackers work wherever defenses are weakest. Sometimes that’s a rounding bug in production code. Sometimes it’s a compromised admin at an open-source project. Sometimes it’s market infrastructure with no failsafes. Static security fails against adaptive threats. Real security means monitoring transactions as they happen, validating every supply chain link, assuming any human with system access could be compromised, and building market infrastructure that doesn’t collapse under stress. It also means assuming every smart contract has an exploit waiting to be found, regardless of how many audits it passed. Security isn’t choosing the right layer to defend. It’s defending all of them. While 2025 was a year of evolving threats and infrastructure stress tests, it wasn’t all dark. The ecosystem also saw incredible milestones in adoption and technical breakthroughs.

https://alphawavess.substack.com/p/bitcoins-three-body-problem-the-forces,Web,Article,Alpha Waves,"On a typical morning in mid-October 2025, a Bitcoin wallet from the Jurassic era came back to life. 3,200 Bitcoin, mined at $12. Worth $400 million when the owner finally sold. By day’s end, sitting in an ETF wrapper inside an Ohio pension fund. In eight hours, capital transferred from a crypto-anarchist pioneer to a retirement portfolio. Our Jurassic miner wasn’t an anomaly. He was part of a mass exodus. Long-term holders distributed over 500,000 BTC around the all-time high. In prior cycles, that would have nuked the order book. This time, the ETFs stood on the other side with a bucket. Old guard sold. New guard bought. Market chopped sideways. As Jordi Visser put it, we’re witnessing a silent IPO. A structural shift from a market owned by individuals to a market rented by institutions. But this stability masks a paradox. Bitcoin was architected to be decentralized. Its ownership remains stubbornly feudal. Whales held 76% of supply in 2011. By 2017, 52%. By 2023, 39%. Today, near 34%. Still concentrated, but slowly democratizing. For most of its history, Bitcoin functioned as a binary system. Believers vs. speculators. Hodlers vs. traders. A violent but predictable orbit. The arrival of institutional infrastructure has introduced a third gravitational force. This isn’t yet a market where price discovery happens through millions of small trades. It’s a market where three distinct tribes pass the baton across cycles. Same asset. Different gravities. Forget the usual labels. Hedge funds. Institutions. Whales. They overlap and confuse. The clean framework is by economic function. Three tribes. Three roles. Three impacts on price. OGs, long-term holders, nation states This tribe isn’t defined by size. It’s defined by time horizon. They remove supply from circulation and distribute only when they’re ready. Not panic selling. Patient rotation. Our Jurassic miner held for thirteen years before distributing into infrastructure that could absorb it. A 2024 Fed study quantified their advantage. Large holders systematically increase positions before price rises. Retail does the opposite. For every 1% increase in whale holdings, next-day returns rose 0.63%. For every 1% increase in retail holdings, next-day returns fell 1.82%. Retail drives volatility. Whales harvest it. But concentration isn’t purely predatory. An analysis of 35,000 whale portfolios found only long-term holders generate positive alpha. Active strategies underperform. The whales who win are the ones who don’t trade. This is what critics miss. The same concentration that enables asymmetric returns also enables conviction. When the Supply Sink refuses to sell through an 85% drawdown, they create the floor from which the next cycle launches. Market makers, exchanges, ETF infrastructure Wintermute. Jane Street. Coinbase. They provide liquidity, arbitrage price gaps, and ensure a pension fund can buy hundreds of millions of IBIT without moving the market 10%. They are the pipes through which capital flows. Our Jurassic miner didn’t broadcast his exit. He routed it through infrastructure designed for discretion. Most whale alerts are noise. The real moves happen quietly, through OTC desks, timed during high buying pressure. Jane Street isn’t betting on Bitcoin. Their role is delta neutrality. When that Ohio pension buys IBIT, Jane Street sources Bitcoin, creates ETF shares, and hedges instantly. They don’t drive directional intent. They execute the flow. But this efficiency comes with a trade-off. Centralizing custody with a few regulated entities has created the largest honeypot in financial history. Efficient, yes. But also a single point of failure. When the Plumbing is active, billion-dollar flows execute smoothly. When they step back, moderate selling triggers cascading liquidations. Hedge funds, prop desks, tactical capital Millennium. Point72. Citadel. Pod shops. Basis traders. Zero loyalty to the asset. They’re renting the trade, using futures, options and perps to bet on volatility. Thirteen of the top 25 US hedge funds owned Bitcoin ETF exposure by Q1 2024. But average allocation was below 1% of portfolio. Testing the waters. Not all in. They're a key reason Bitcoin rallies 40% in a month and drops 30% in eight weeks. Their leverage creates the initial move. Retail follows, amplifying it. Price triggers liquidations, which trigger more price moves. Some critics argue this tribe trades “paper Bitcoin,” claims on the asset that exceed the underlying supply. Whether true or not, their influence on short-term price action is undeniable. December’s retreat is about self-preservation. Managers are crystallizing year-end performance fees. The mercenaries have gone home to count their money. Actually constructive. The market needs a positioning reset. This tribe amplifies the verticality. For most of its life, Bitcoin was a closed system. OGs set the float. Exchanges held the pipes. Retail and leverage set marginal price. The feedback was circular and violent. The 2024 ETF approvals rewired the demand channel. IBIT became the fastest ETF ever to $100 billion AUM. Demand is now equity-market native. Flows concentrate when New York opens. The marginal buyer is patient. That Ohio pension doesn’t check Bitcoin’s price. Doesn’t panic-sell drawdowns. Rebalances quarterly. When Bitcoin drops 30%, that means buying. The herding effect is dampened. When ETFs absorb distribution, the signal never reaches retail. Panic doesn’t trigger. Cascade doesn’t start. Sticky supply still gates the cycle. Distribution still happens. ETFs just change who absorbs it. Derivatives still manufacture reflexivity. October proved leverage risk is alive and well. Just layered onto a system with more shock absorbers. So what does this transition mean for the four-year cycle? I broke down the anatomy of this pattern in Macro Autopsy of Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycles Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argues the traditional cycle is over. His case: volatility compression (Bitcoin was less volatile than Nvidia in 2025), institutional dampening (ETFs absorb supply steadily), and macro integration (Bitcoin now trades like a risk asset, correlated to Nasdaq and sensitive to Fed policy). Glassnode offers the counterpoint: the cycle isn’t dead, just different. Long-term holder profit-taking has reached levels comparable to past euphoric phases. The handoff from OGs to ETF buyers is the same wealth transfer that marked every prior top. The mechanics are almost identical. Only the counterparty has changed. The truth probably lies somewhere between. Optimists see institutions as passive floor buyers. The floor rises each cycle. Skeptics counter that institutions lack diamond hands. They have mandates, not conviction. Mandates change. 2011: drawdown of 93%. 2015: drawdown of 85%. 2018: drawdown of 86%. 2022: drawdown of 77%. 2025: drawdown of 31% (so far) Whether this cycle stays shallow or eventually capitulates, only time will tell. Bitcoin has humbled every premature declaration of a “new paradigm” before. For now, the cycle isn’t dead. It’s just (so far) been gentrified. The Supply Sink has been distributing since October. Long-term holder supply peaked alongside the all-time high. Veterans are selling faster than new buyers can accumulate. The floor is holding at $80-90K, but momentum to reclaim highs has evaporated. The Plumbing is wounded and adding to the pressure. As I detailed in The Wound Beneath the Wick, the October 10th liquidation cascade left scars. Key liquidity providers took balance sheet damage. They’re not just struggling to absorb selling. They’re unwinding inventory to repair their own books. The $277 million ETF outflow on December 16 was a reminder. Pipes move both directions. The Swing Vote is flushed. Open interest down from October highs. Mercenaries protecting year-end P&L. Add it all up: a massive handover of inventory. Old Vaults distributing. Wounded Plumbing deleveraging. Mercenaries sidelined. New Vaults trying to absorb it all. The boring zone of institutional accumulation. Painful, but necessary. Bitcoin’s market structure has evolved meaningfully this cycle. The asset that once defined itself by chaos is becoming something else. Not boring. Not predictable. But analyzable. The Supply Sink sets the floor. When they distribute at scale, the cycle is late. The Plumbing determines efficiency. When they step back, volatility explodes. The Swing Vote drives momentum. When they lever up, corrections are sharp. The whales are still there. They’re just wearing different suits. The old playbook was simple. Buy the halving, sell the mania. The new playbook requires more work. Follow the tribes. Watch who’s accumulating, who’s distributing, who’s providing the liquidity in between. Our Jurassic miner is gone from the network now. His coins live on in a different form. Fractional ownership inside an ETF wrapper, held by a pension fund that will never think about them. He waited over a decade for infrastructure that could absorb his exit. Sold into the most liquid Bitcoin market in history. He traded sovereignty for liquidity. In 2011, whales held 76% of supply. Today, closer to 34%. The invisible hand isn’t a single whale anymore. It’s three distinct tribes with radically different time horizons. Passing the baton across cycles. Absorbing each other’s distribution. Building the floor higher with each transition. Understanding their dynamics isn’t just analysis. Thanks for reading!

https://cointegrity.substack.com/p/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-storm,Web,Article,Torstein,"The dust is still settling from Friday’s $19.3 billion liquidation event, but enough data has emerged to piece together what actually happened. This wasn’t just a market crash triggered by Trump’s tariffs. It was a chain reaction where geopolitical shock, exchange vulnerabilities, and what appears to be opportunistic exploitation converged in a 90-minute window that will be studied for years. On October 6, Binance publicly announced they would update the pricing mechanisms for three specific assets: USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL. The old system valued these assets using Binance’s internal spot market prices for cross-margin collateral calculations. The new system would use Oracle-based pricing. Implementation was scheduled for October 14. That created an eight-day window where everyone knew the vulnerability existed. Anyone paying attention understood that these three assets could potentially be manipulated on Binance during this transition period. This wasn’t insider knowledge. It was public information. To understand the full picture, it is also important to understand what these tokens are, as they are not “standard” tokens like BTC or ETH.USDe (Ethena) is a synthetic dollar stablecoin designed to maintain a $1.00 peg through a delta-neutral hedging strategy. It’s not backed by traditional reserves like USDC or USDT, but by a combination of collateral and perpetual futures positions. This makes it more complex and potentially more fragile than traditional stablecoins. wBETH (Wrapped Beacon ETH) is Binance’s liquid staking token for Ethereum. When you stake ETH on Binance, you receive wBETH, which represents your staked ETH plus accumulated staking rewards. It should trade slightly above ETH’s price (currently around 1.07-1.08x ETH) because it includes those rewards. A crash to $430 when ETH was trading above $4,000 means it was valued at roughly 10% of what it should be worth, an absurd mispricing. BNSOL (Binance Staked SOL) is the same concept for Solana. It’s a liquid staking token that represents your staked SOL plus rewards, and should trade at a premium to SOL’s price. None of these are simple stablecoins. They’re all derivative assets that derive their value from underlying positions. That makes them more complex to price correctly, but it also makes them vulnerable to oracle manipulation if the pricing mechanism relies on a single exchange’s spot market during thin liquidity (and in this lies the key). Friday, October 10, 4:57 PM EDT: Trump announces 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods. This wasn’t entirely unexpected; he’d been threatening tariffs for weeks, but the scale and timing caught markets off guard. Bitcoin, which had been trading around $119,000, begins to slide. Traditional markets panic. Crypto follows. This is the first domino. Without this macro shock, nothing else that followed would have worked. The tariff announcement made markets nervous, created volatility, and set the stage for what came next. On the same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1 billion in short positions on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The timing? Approximately 30 minutes before Trump’s official announcement. The wallet address is public: 0xb317D2BC2D3d2Df5Fa441B5bAE0AB9d8b07283ae Here’s where it gets complicated. Taking a large short position ahead of potential tariff news isn’t unreasonable. Trump had been threatening 100% tariffs. The geopolitical situation was tense. A sophisticated trader with a bearish macro view might well position for downside. The 30-minute timing is extraordinary, but not impossible. When the crash came, those shorts printed $192 million in profit. On Sunday, the same wallet opened a new $163 million short position, suggesting either continued bearish conviction or access to information the rest of us don’t have. On-chain investigators have traced transaction fees to an ENS address (garrettjin.eth), but we cannot confirm identity with certainty. What we know: the wallet has been active since at least 2011, holds over 100,000 BTC across multiple addresses, and clearly knows what they’re doing. To understand what happened next, you need to understand what market makers do. Market makers are firms that continuously place buy and sell orders on both sides of the market. When you want to sell Bitcoin, you’re usually selling to a market maker’s buy order. When you want to buy, you’re buying from their sell order. They profit from the tiny spread between the two, and in return, they provide liquidity, the cushion that absorbs normal market volatility. But market makers aren’t charities. When volatility spikes and price movements become unpredictable, they pull their orders. It’s a safety measure. If they kept providing liquidity during a cascade, they’d get run over by the liquidation wave and lose everything. So they step aside and wait for stability. This is normal behavior, not malicious. Here’s the timeline (all times UTC+8, Asian morning hours): 5:00 AM: Bitcoin decline from $119,000 begins following the tariff news. Trading volumes are elevated but within manageable parameters. 5:20 AM: The first liquidation cascade begins. Altcoin liquidations accelerate. Volume spikes 10x normal levels. This is consistent with overleveraged positions getting hit. Market makers start widening their spreads and reducing position sizes. Some begin pulling liquidity entirely. 5:43 AM: Someone dumps $60-90 million worth of USDe on Binance’s spot market. USDe’s price on Binance crashes to $0.65. On every other exchange, it holds near $1.00. This isn’t a global depeg. This is a Binance-specific event, exploiting the  existing vulnerability. 5:44 AM: wBETH (stablecoin linked to ETH) crashes to $430 (89% below ETH’s value). BNSOL (Stablecoin linked to SOL) tumbles to $34.90. These are the three assets with announced oracle updates. Only on Binance. Nowhere else. Because Binance’s Unified Account system valued collateral using internal spot prices, the exchange’s system revalued every account using these assets as collateral and began force-liquidating positions. Estimated forced liquidations on Binance alone: $500 million to $1 billion. 6:30 AM: Market makers are completely withdrawn. There are no buy orders to absorb the forced selling. Prices go into freefall. Total liquidations reach $19.3 billion across all exchanges. Here’s what we don’t know: whether the Hyperliquid shorts and the Binance USDe dump came from the same entity. The CCN article and other sources speculate about coordination, but there’s no definitive on-chain evidence linking the two operations. It’s possible they’re the same actor. It’s also possible they’re completely separate: Scenario 1 - Coordinated Attack: Someone with $1.1B in shorts positioned on Hyperliquid spent $60-90M to dump USDe on Binance, knowing it would trigger a cascade that would make their shorts profitable. Cost: $60-90M. Gain: $192M. Net: ~$100-130M profit - Happy days… Scenario 2 - Separate Opportunists: The Hyperliquid whale took a reasonable bearish position ahead of potential tariff news. Separately, someone else noticed the Binance vulnerability window and decided to exploit it. Both profited, but independently. Scenario 3 - Hidden Binance Shorts: The real profit might have come from short positions on Binance itself, which aren’t publicly visible like Hyperliquid’s on-chain data. The Hyperliquid whale is just the most visible actor, not necessarily the orchestrator. We don’t have enough evidence to determine which scenario is correct. What we can say is that the USDe dump was almost certainly deliberate exploitation of a known vulnerability. Whether it was coordinated with the Hyperliquid shorts remains speculation. Hyperliquid saw $10.31 billion in liquidations and over 1,000 wallets were completely wiped out. Binance paid $283 million in compensation and absorbed an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in internal losses. Lighter exchange went offline for hours. In total, 1.64 million accounts were liquidated, with 358 accounts completely zeroed out and 206 traders losing over $1 million each. But not everything broke. Aave’s token crashed 64%, but the protocol itself handled $180 million in liquidations flawlessly without human intervention. DeFi perp funding rates spiked to 10,000%+ APY, proving the mechanism works to rebalance markets even under extreme stress. BitMEX processed its highest volume since December 2021, with only $2 million in insurance fund losses. The contrast is stark: centralized exchanges with complex cross-margin systems that can be weaponized versus decentralized protocols that bent but didn’t break. It’s 01:00 CET Tuesday as I write this. By the end of the week, we expect to hear about treasury companies that were liquidated or forced to unwind positions. Strategy (MicroStrategy) bought 220 BTC at $123,000 right before the crash and saw its stock drop 18%. Abraxas Capital is sitting on $119.2 million in unrealized losses. Fifteen percent of digital asset treasury companies are now trading below their net asset value, meaning their stock is worth less than the crypto they hold. The Hyperliquid whale is still out there with a fresh $163 million short. China still isn’t picking up the phone when the US calls. And the market just got a brutal reminder that leverage, thin liquidity, and geopolitical shocks are a dangerous combination. This was a perfect storm. Each element alone would have been manageable: The tariff announcement created volatility and spooked markets, but crypto has weathered worse macro shocks. The Binance vulnerability was known and scheduled to be fixed within days. Market makers pulling liquidity is normal risk management during extreme volatility. The USDe dump exploited a specific window when all these factors aligned. Together, they created a cascade that destroyed $19.3 billion in value in 90 minutes. The companies that survived this are the ones with proper hedging, spot holdings, and actual risk controls. The ones that relied on leverage and hopeium; we’ll know soon enough. DeFi proved more resilient than many expected. Funding rate mechanisms worked. Automated liquidation systems functioned without breaking. The infrastructure held up better than centralized exchanges with their complex cross-margin systems. But the biggest lesson is this: transparency is a double-edged sword. Binance announced their oracle fix eight days in advance. That announcement created the attack window. In trying to be transparent about improvements, they inadvertently painted a target. Hope is not a strategy. Risk management is everything. This is a preliminary analysis based on available data as of October 14, 2025, More information will emerge in the coming days.","October 14, 2025",0
https://getirked.substack.com/p/why-bitcoin-whales-are-the-real-puppet,Web,Article,GetIrked,"If you’ve spent any time scrolling through X (formerly Twitter) or lurking in crypto forums, you’ve probably heard the whispers: Bitcoin whales are pulling the strings behind those wild price swings. But is it just tinfoil-hat paranoia, or is there fire behind the smoke? I decided to dig deeper. If big players get slapped with fines for market shenanigans in the stock world all the time, why wouldn’t they exploit a frontier market like crypto where the sheriff’s still saddling up his horse? Let’s investigate: Who are these whales? How might they be gaming the system? And what does it mean for your portfolio in 2026 and beyond? First off, a quick primer. Bitcoin “whales” are the mega-holders — individuals, institutions, or early miners controlling massive stashes of BTC, often 1,000+ coins worth tens of millions at current prices. With Bitcoin’s market cap hovering around $2 trillion in late 2025, these players aren’t just swimming in the pond; they’re the pond. Data shows that just 2,500 wallets command about 30% of Bitcoin’s supply — roughly $690 billion in today’s dollars. That’s enough firepower to nudge prices with a single trade, let alone a coordinated splash. Think of them like the old oil barons of Texas: They don’t need to own the whole ranch to control the flow. In crypto’s low-liquidity waters, a whale’s buy or sell can ripple into tsunamis, triggering stop-losses and panic sells from retail traders like you and me. Crypto operates in a regulatory vacuum. Unlike the NYSE, where the SEC pounces on spoofing or insider trading faster than you can say “pump and dump,” Bitcoin trades 24/7 on decentralized exchanges with minimal oversight. Sure, some countries like the U.S. are tightening the noose with ETF approvals and AML rules, but global coordination? It’s a joke. In traditional markets, whales (or “institutions”) get busted routinely — remember the 2020 GameStop saga, where hedge funds were accused of naked shorting? Or the flash crashes engineered by high-frequency traders? Crypto? It’s basically legal to coordinate a pump if you’re sly about it. No central authority means no subpoenas for chat logs from Telegram groups plotting the next surge. And as one analyst put it in a 2025 report, “The crypto market is no longer decentralized, but ‘regulatory theater’ at best.” If there’s a market you can sway without handcuffs, ask yourself: Wouldn’t the whales? History screams yes. To test the theory, I scoured recent on-chain data and news. Spoiler: The evidence isn’t just circumstantial — it’s flashing red lights. Take October 2025’s brutal $20 billion crypto meltdown. In a single day, positions vaporized across exchanges in a “violent and sudden” cascade. On-chain sleuths pointed to whale coordination: Massive sells from long-dormant wallets triggered liquidations, only for the same addresses to scoop up the dip hours later at fire-sale prices. Was it organic panic or a engineered rug-pull? The blockchain doesn’t lie—transaction clusters suggest premeditation. Fast-forward to November: Long-term holders dumped a staggering 400,000 BTC — $45 billion worth—over just one month, unbalancing the market and dragging BTC toward six-month lows around $95,000. Short-term whales offloaded another 29,400 BTC at a loss, per multiple reports, sparking FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) that amplified the slide. X lit up with chatter: “Whales are clearly shaking the market... trigger fear, buy the dip, then pump it back up.” Meanwhile, newer whales accumulated 45,000 BTC amid the chaos, positioning for the rebound. Even altcoin pumps show the pattern. Zcash (ZEC) spiked suspiciously in mid-November, with users speculating “old Bitcoin whales” were pivoting to pump it “HARD” like they did BTC years ago—before BlackRock and Binance “controlled” the king coin. Coordinated? Maybe. But in a market where ETFs now rival whales for control, these moves hint at a power struggle. These aren’t isolated blips; they’re patterns echoing past cycles, like the 2017 “whale signs” before dumps or the 2020 hash-rate rebound masking insider pumps. How do they pull it off? It’s textbook manipulation, crypto-style. Whales start with accumulation—quietly buying dips via OTC desks to avoid spiking prices. Then comes the pump: Coordinated buys flood exchanges, often synced via private Discords or signals on X/Telegram. Volume surges, FOMO kicks in, retail piles on. Price moons 20-50% in hours. Enter the dump: Whales sell into the frenzy, cashing out at peaks while triggering cascades of stop-losses. The price craters, they rebuy low, rinse, repeat. Tools like Whale Alert track these moves in real-time, but by then, the damage is done. Past examples abound—from 2013 email scams hyping penny cryptos to modern “ranked” Telegram groups giving VIPs 3-second edges on signals. In low-cap alts, it’s blatant; in BTC, subtler, often disguised as “market making.” And coordination? Easier than ever. No radio ads needed — just a group chat and bots. Studies show these schemes thrive in crypto’s volatility, with pumps averaging 50% gains before the rug. Pump-and-dumps aren’t crypto inventions — they’re as old as markets. The 1920s Radio Corporation of America scam bilked investors out of fortunes via hyped “whispers” before a crash. Today, equities see $10B+ in fines yearly for spoofing. Crypto’s twist? Scale and speed. A whale wall — fake buy orders to scare shorts — once took days in stocks; now it’s minutes on Binance. But here’s the kicker: In regulated markets, whales face jail. In crypto? They are the market. As ETFs flood in, we’re seeing a hybrid: Institutional “whales” like BlackRock battling OG hodlers, but the game stays rigged for the big fish. So, what’s a retail investor to do? First, you can DYOR (do your own research) by tracking whale wallets via Glassnode or Santiment. Spot red flags: Sudden volume spikes without news? Whale dumps during euphoria? Steer clear. For me, the key is having a long-term time horizon. If you believe the pundits who claim Bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000; $2,500,000; or even more in the future, then getting scared out by a Whale Dump is fruitless. I follow the same discipline with my crypto investments as I do with my stock investments: “Buy on Red Days, Sell on Green Days.” In other words, when the Whales dump, I have two choices: I can add to positions or I can hold, I never sell into a panic. Additionally, these Whale Dumps often provide outstanding buying opportunities for the shrewd investor or trader who keeps significant cash on the sidelines. By adding in stages to my crypto positions on the way down — just like I do with my equity holdings — I am able to capitalize on the panic the Whales’ dumps engender rather than falling prey to it. What do you think? Seen whale games in action? Drop your takes below. Until next time, keep stacking sats... wisely. Read on to discover the week’s biggest winner and loser in the Investments in Play portfolio as well as all the moves I made this week in addition to my future buying and selling price targets for the positions that saw changes over the week.",October 2025,0
https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoins-october-purge-was-trumps,Web,Article,In Bitcoin We Trust,"The screens bled red. In the span of three hours, a year’s worth of manic optimism, leverage, and greed was violently expunged from the system. A trillion dollars in digital wealth vanished into the ether. Bitcoin, which had been flirting with historic highs just days earlier, was in a freefall. The digital asset space was a scene of pure, unadulterated carnage. The headlines screamed what everyone was feeling: “CRYPTO MARKET IN MELTDOWN.” But this was no random act of market volatility. This was a calculated strike, a geopolitical power play that used the crypto market as its collateral damage. And for those watching closely on-chain, the warning signs appeared 48 hours before the first drop of blood hit the floor. This wasn’t just a crash; it was an assassination. And it was all pre-planned. In the arcane world of blockchain analytics, some wallets carry more weight than others. These are the primordial accounts, wallets created in the days when Bitcoin was a fringe experiment for cypherpunks. They lie dormant for years, sometimes a decade, their vast holdings a silent testament to a bygone era. When they move, the market pays attention. Two days before the chaos, one such wallet, dormant since 2013, flickered to life. There was no catalyst, no headline-grabbing news to justify its actions. It was just a silent, methodical movement on-chain. Through a series of complex transactions designed to mask its intent, the entity began opening colossal short positions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The total exposure was estimated in the billions.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/10/21/locked-out-and-liquidated-traders-blame-binance-for-19-billion-crash/,Web,Article,Forbes,"Over 25 minutes on October 10th and 11th, $19 billion in leveraged positions evaporated across crypto markets. What should have been an orderly deleveraging turned into something far worse: a cascade where the safety mechanisms designed to prevent catastrophic losses instead amplified them. Market makers faced two simultaneous infrastructure failures on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. Some found themselves completely locked out, unable to place risk-reducing orders despite hundreds of attempts over nearly two hours. Others were forcibly deleveraged at prices so disconnected from market reality that hedging became impossible. Both groups did what any rational participant would do: they withdrew their remaining liquidity and stepped away from their screens. Without market makers providing continuous bid and ask quotes, retail traders found themselves in a vacuum. Orders froze. Buyers disappeared. An estimated 1.5 million to 1.7 million traders were liquidated as prices spiraled downward with no natural resistance. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s Vault, a decentralized perpetuals exchange’s insurance fund, reportedly gained over $40 million in fees and liquidations from the chaos. The uncomfortable question hanging over the aftermath: did some participants receive preferential treatment that helped them survive while others burned? A trader tells the story through 812.eth’s X account. When they logged into Binance on the morning of October 11th, Beijing time, to find his account balance somewhere between $3.9 million and $4.1 million. By the time the liquidation engine finished with him, he had 22 cents remaining. This wasn’t the result of reckless gambling or a bad directional bet. According to detailed logs shared by 812.eth, their algorithmic trading system had run normally for 1,137 consecutive days. The system's first reaction to the drawdown wasn't to double down but to execute preset risk controls: reduce exposure, cut positions quickly. At 05:12 UTC+8, as the market accelerated downward, the bot issued a series of ReduceOnly orders. These orders, by design, can only decrease position size, never increase it. They represent the last line of defense in any sound trading system. Binance's own documentation states that ReduceOnly orders receive priority during periods of high traffic because they reduce risk rather than add to it. The bot tried to sell 3 million DOGE tokens to bring a 3.4 million token position down. The collateral at the time was roughly $656,000, with an unrealized loss of about $266,000. On XRP, the system attempted to cut a 7,326 token position down to one-fifth its size by placing a ReduceOnly order for 5,860 tokens. Every attempt was rejected. The error codes tell the story: NEW_ORDER_REJECTED (-2010), ReduceOnly Order Failed (-4118, -2022), Server is busy, please try again later (-1008), and HTTP 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable. Over the next 106 minutes, the bot made more than 200 attempts to reduce positions. All failed. The positions remained fully exposed during the worst window of market volatility. The unrealized losses became very real: approximately $444,000 on DOGE and $148,000 on XRP, totaling nearly $592,000 in losses that should have been prevented by the exchange's own priority order system. The logs show both infrastructure failures and business logic failures happening simultaneously. The HTTP 503 errors and -1008 codes indicate the exchange's infrastructure was overloaded. But the -4118 and -2022 codes show that even when the system could process requests, it was actively rejecting the very orders that should have been allowed through first. 812.eth was not alone. Multiple market makers have provided similar evidence showing systematic rejection of risk-reducing orders during the same time window across multiple trading pairs and account structures. This wasn't a network problem on the user side. This was the platform itself. Wintermute, one of the largest and most sophisticated crypto market makers, faced a different but equally destructive problem. When an exchange's insurance fund depletes during extreme volatility, it activates Auto-Deleveraging, known as ADL. This mechanism forcibly closes profitable positions to cover the losses of bankrupt accounts. In theory, ADL is a fair way to socialize losses when the exchange runs out of money to cover them. Everyone with a profitable position takes a haircut in proportion to their profit and leverage. The problem, according to Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy on The Block podcast, was the price at which they were deleveraged. ""Binance ADL'd us at $5 and the token was trading at like $1, and you don't even have a chance to hedge basically,"" Gaevoy said. ""It's fine to get ADL'd if you can hedge, but sometimes you get ADL'd at completely ridiculous prices."" This matters more than it might initially appear. Market makers run hedged positions across multiple venues and instruments. When you're forcibly closed at $5 but the actual market price is $1, you cannot hedge that position at anything close to your closing price. You're forced to realize a loss based on a price that doesn't exist in any liquid market. Wintermute is large enough to have direct communication lines with exchanges. They can call someone when things go wrong. If a market maker of their caliber faced these issues, smaller market makers likely fared considerably worse. Market participants have begun asking whether some firms received preferential treatment through ADL protection agreements. Multiple traders on X have alleged that Ethena, the synthetic dollar protocol, has special arrangements with exchanges like Binance that kept their USDe short hedges from being auto-deleveraged. If true, this creates an asymmetry problem. ADL has to close someone's profitable positions to cover losses. If certain participants are protected from ADL, the burden falls more heavily on everyone else. This would mean that while Ethena's hedges stayed open, preventing a true USDe depeg and potential protocol failure, other market makers absorbed disproportionate hits. Reposts from Wintermute’s co-founder suggest he believes opaque ADL protection mechanisms played a significant role in amplifying the crash's severity. The opacity is the real issue here. No one outside the exchange can verify ADL priority structures. Users cannot see who has special agreements or how the queue actually functions under stress. The entire system operates on trust that the exchange will treat participants fairly during the exact moments when fairness matters most. The cascade began with something entirely external to crypto: President Trump announced tariffs of 100 percent to 157 percent on Chinese goods. Markets processed this as a risk-off signal. The sequence that followed was mechanical and, in hindsight, entirely predictable. According to crypto trader ltrd, first came a coordinated $60 million to $90 million sell-off of portfolio margin collateral assets on Binance: USDe, wrapped Ethereum staking tokens like wBETH, and Binance staked SOL. These assets serve as collateral for leveraged positions. When their prices drop, the value of that collateral drops, triggering margin calls and liquidations. As liquidations mounted, Binance's insurance fund began depleting. When insurance funds run dry, Auto-Deleveraging activates. This is when market makers started getting hit, either through API lockouts preventing them from adjusting positions, or through ADL at prices that made hedging impossible. Market makers responded rationally: they pulled their remaining liquidity from the order books to avoid further losses. When market makers withdraw, the bid and ask quotes that provide continuous trading disappear. Retail traders suddenly found themselves unable to exit positions because there were no buyers. The lack of buyers meant orders either didn't execute or executed at catastrophic prices. This triggered more liquidations, which triggered more ADL events, which pushed more market makers away. Each step fed into the next. The system worked exactly as it was designed to work. That's the problem. By the time the cascade finished, 1.5 million to 1.7 million traders had been liquidated. Hyperliquid, operating with transparent on-chain mechanisms, reportedly gained over $40 million in fees and liquidations from traders seeking alternatives to centralized exchange opacity. The question of priority routing cuts to the heart of market fairness. In his X thread, 812.eth made a pointed allegation: The parallel to FTX is impossible to ignore, even if the situations are radically different. Alameda Research, the trading firm connected to FTX, had special privileges on that exchange, including exemptions from auto-liquidation and the ability to maintain negative balances. That arrangement contributed to FTX's collapse and is now central to the fraud case against Sam Bankman-Fried. No one is suggesting Binance's situation is the same. But the questions are legitimate. In periods of extreme volatility, the ability to place orders becomes everything. If larger firms or those with special agreements receive preferential access, what does that mean for market integrity? If your orders are systematically rejected while someone else's go through, are you really trading on a fair venue? The competitive market among exchanges should theoretically prevent the worst abuses. Traders can move to venues that treat them better. But when you're already in positions during a crisis, switching venues doesn't help. You need to be able to close what you have, where you have it. In post-incident communications, either Binance or its cloud infrastructure provider mentioned a ""10 percent rejection rate"" during the crisis period. Multiple market makers have challenged this figure as incompatible with their documented experience. 812.eth's logs show a rejection rate approaching 100 percent for ReduceOnly orders during the critical 05:12 to 07:02 UTC+8 window. When asked for the statistical methodology, sample size, or audit reports behind the 10 percent claim, no response was provided. Independent analysis of price behavior supports the market makers' version. A deviation report compiled by a researcher identified as Benson compared Binance's spot prices during the crash to those on OKX, Bybit, Bitget and Gate. Despite having the deepest liquidity pools in crypto, Binance experienced more severe price dislocations than smaller competitors. During the critical 25-minute window, 31 tokens on Binance crashed more than 100 percent below the price on the next-worst exchange. Another 18 tokens crashed between 50 percent and 75 percent below peers. Only 53 tokens, representing 22 percent of the total, stayed within a 1 percent deviation from other venues. The numbers are counterintuitive. Deeper liquidity should cushion crashes, not amplify them. But when the largest liquidity providers are locked out via API failures or hammered by ADL at unrealistic prices, depth becomes irrelevant. The order book loses its structural support. What should be the most stable venue becomes the most volatile. Binance did issue $283 million in reimbursements related to depegging issues during the crash. This compensation addressed losses from collateral assets losing their pegs. It did not address losses from API failures preventing order placement or from ADL at prices disconnected from liquid markets. The systemic risks exposed by October 10th and 11th go beyond any single exchange. The combination of extreme leverage, opaque crisis management mechanisms, and potential preferential treatment creates a fragile system. When that fragility meets an external shock, the results are predictable. The centralized exchange versus decentralized exchange divide becomes relevant here. On a DEX, you can (theoretically) review the liquidation mechanism in the smart contract code. Transparency can be a curse, but also a gift. The rules are transparent and apply uniformly because code doesn't grant special favors. On a CEX, you trust that the exchange will treat you fairly during the exact moments when your capital is most at risk. For retail traders, the trust problem is acute. If the safety mechanisms designed to let you exit positions might lock you out instead, how do you manage risk? If larger participants might have priority access that you don't, how do you compete? If ADL might close your positions at prices that don't exist in liquid markets, how do you hedge? These aren't abstract questions. They directly affect whether rational traders should hold leveraged positions on centralized venues at all. The October 10th and 11th crash revealed something important: these weren’t just bugs in the system. The API issues, the ADL, the preferential routing, the liquidity withdrawal by market makers, the cascade into retail liquidations were all features of how these systems are designed to handle stress. When 1.7 million traders get liquidated and $19 billion in positions evaporate while venues gain millions in fees, the question isn’t just what went wrong on those two days. The question is whether the fundamental architecture of leverage trading is fit for purpose during the only times when it really matters: when everything goes wrong at once. The data suggests it might not be. And until exchanges provide transparent, auditable information about their crisis management systems, priority structures, and ADL mechanisms, that question will continue to hang over every leveraged trade placed on centralized venues.","October 10-11, 2025",0

Estimated reading time: 4 minutes A record $19 billion crypto liquidation rocked markets this month. Discover what caused the crash and what it means for long- and short-term investors. Welcome to the Canadian Crypto Observer. Financial journalist and author Aditya Nain offers perspective on market-moving headlines to help Canadian investors navigate the cryptocurrency market. As noted in the previous edition of this column, Bitcoin’s (BTC) strongest months have historically been October and November—up an average of 21.89% and 46.02%, respectively. In keeping with this promise, the crypto market started October strong as BTC ran up from about $114,000 (all figures in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified) on October 1 to a new high of over $126,000 on October 7. Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and other altcoins also saw impressive runaway gains in the first week of October. But optimism was quickly, if only temporarily, sucked out of the crypto market as BTC, ETH, and other crypto prices saw a sharp decline from the 10th to the 17th of October before stabilizing. As of 28th October, BTC is trading flat, between $113,000 and $115,000—close to the price it was at the beginning of the month. The chart below shows the ups and downs of the crypto market over the past month, as represented by the Coinmarkcap (CMC) 20 Index, an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins. In a 24-hour period from October 10 to 11, the cryptocurrency market experienced the biggest liquidation event in its history, triggered by Trump’s announcement of a possible 100% tariff on China, in addition to certain export controls. A “liquidation event” is a short span of time in which traders are forced to close their leveraged crypto positions because of a sharp and sudden fall in prices. On October 10–11, a sharp fall in prices forced traders with leveraged long positions in crypto assets to be liquidated because the market went against their bet. These liquidations caused the market to fall further, which, in-turn, triggered additional liquidations in a cascading effect. Here’s how bad it was: During the fall in prices from October 7 to 17, BTC fell over 17% (from about $126,000 to just over $104,000) and ETH fell over 21% (from about $4,700 to about $3,700)For historical context, here are the five largest liquidation events in crypto market history, according to coinglass.com Article Continues Below Advertisement Was the October liquidation event a long-term buying opportunity or a sign of more turbulence to come? There’s no way to know for sure, but here is one way to answer the question: We’ve ranked the best crypto exchanges in Canada. If you’re a crypto investor in Canada or are thinking about dipping your toes in the market, it pays to choose your crypto exchange carefully so you’re not being taken advantage of, falling prey to a scam, or supporting a company involved in illegal activity. Canadian crypto exchange Cryptomus was fined a whopping CAD$177 million by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). FINTRAC found over a thousand instances where Cryptomus did not adequately report transactions and crypto wallets with ties to serious criminal activity. While the crypto market is a lot more mature and well regulated than it was just five years ago, it unfortunately remains a hotbed of financial scams and other criminal activity.To protect themselves and to promote the use of crypto in Canada for legal purposes, Canadian crypto investors should know that crypto exchanges in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the regulatory body responsible for harmonizing securities regulation across the thirteen provinces and territories. On its website, the CSA provides a list of crypto platforms authorized to do business with Canadians and those banned in Canada. Canadian crypto investors would be well advised to go through both lists before they decide which platform to use. Cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, BNB and others are speculative and highly volatile assets subject to significant price movements. Even stablecoins, which are seemingly “safe,” may be risky if not adequately backed by real-world assets.Investing in bitcoin and other crypto coins carries significant market, technological, and regulatory risks. Invest in crypto only if it aligns with your broader investment goals, time horizon, and risk profile, and always stay vigilant about crypto scams. Share this article

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-crash-incoming-long-term-121715066.html,Web,Article,Yahoo Finance,"Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling a lot right now, putting downward pressure on the price. The market has absorbed much of this selling so far, with big buyers stepping in to support it. A full crash is unlikely in the near term, but Bitcoin could still drop further if selling continues. Bitcoin (BTC) has started 2026 on shaky ground, grinding between $88,000 and $90,000 after falling hard from its $124,000 peak. As the market searches for a clear direction, one storyline is dominating the conversation. Long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs)—investors who have held BTC for at least 155 days—may be starting to sell in size. If that trend holds, it could add fresh pressure to an already fragile market and fuel fears that a deeper pullback is still ahead. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin long-term holders are dumping BTC faster than during the October 2025 crash. Over the past 30 days, these LTHs have sold approximately 143,000 BTC, valued at around $9.5 billion at current prices. This marks the fastest pace of divestment since August 2025, reversing a brief accumulation phase from late December 2025 to early January 2026. Glassnode’s data shows that mid-term holders (1-5 years) are still offloading supply, while longer-term holders (over 5 years) show signs of stabilization or even minor accumulation. For instance, the BTC supply that has been inactive for over five years increased by 95,500 coins in the last month, suggesting that not all veteran holders are panicking. However, this selling adds supply to the market and puts downward pressure on prices. CryptoQuant echoes this, noting that LTH sales began when prices surpassed $40,000, distinguishing this cycle from previous bull markets where holders were more steadfast. Bitcoin’s price weakness isn’t isolated to LTH behavior. Over 22% of BTC supply is held at a loss, a level last seen in early 2022 and mid-2018, heightening sensitivity to further declines. Short-term holders (STHs), who are price-sensitive, are particularly vulnerable; their spent output profit ratio sits at 0.99, just below breakeven, suggesting potential capitulation if support breaks. Glassnode warned that failure to hold key levels, such as the -1 standard deviation of the STH cost basis or the true market mean, could resume LTH selling. Macro factors add layers of complexity to the current bearish market trends. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged despite a depleting dollar. Institutional inflows via spot ETFs have been mixed, with $1.3 billion in outflows recently, yet firms like Strategy have absorbed over 40,000 BTC in 2026 alone. This institutional buying counters retail leverage unwinding; over $1 billion in positions liquidated in a single day recently, creating forced selling cascades. While selling pressure is evident, a full-blown crash appears unlikely in the near term, though downside volatility remains a concern. The October 2025 deleveraging event wiped out $19 billion in positions, echoing past cycles in which leverage, not fundamentals, drove crashes. Yet, current leverage is lower, with investors favoring hedging options over futures bets. Exchange inflows are at 2020 lows, implying holders aren’t rushing to sell. Not all indicators scream doom. For example, realized capitalization, a measure of real money entering the network, hit new highs, signaling sustained interest beyond speculation. Even isolated sales, like a 12-year holder offloading 500 BTC, haven’t sparked panic, as institutions have absorbed the flow. Global liquidity supports BTC in the short term, though growth is slowing. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s structure is healthier, with less leverage and more defensive investor behavior. The market has absorbed most of the LTH high intensity sales, with decelerating outflows and institutional backstops preventing a freefall. A crash would require cascading failures: broken supports, renewed leverage builds, or macro shocks like aggressive rate hikes. Current data suggests resilience, with Bitcoin potentially consolidating before liquidity returns. The post Bitcoin Crash Incoming?

trades at $90,605 today (Sunday), January 11, 2026, attempting a modest 0.24%
rebound after experiencing five consecutive days of declines. The world's
largest cryptocurrency remains trapped in a prolonged consolidation pattern,
down approximately 28% from its October 2025 all-time high of $126,198. While
many investors ask why Bitcoin is going down, the answer lies in critical
technical breakdowns that point toward significantly lower prices ahead. Potentially
$68,000 to $74,000 according to my weekly chart analysis. In this article, I explain why Bitcoin is falling and
why it could drop by another 25%. Check out my technical analysis of the

    Read this Term has
experienced five consecutive days of declines and during Sunday’s session
attempted a modest 0.3% rebound, changing hands at just under $91,000. On the
daily chart, we remain in the same consolidation and nothing particularly
interesting is happening. For a fresh
perspective, I decided to look at a slightly broader interval, namely the
weekly chart, which brings interesting observations from a technical analysis
point of view. As I show
on the weekly chart, we see exactly the same consolidation pattern and support
zone defined by April 2025 lows between $78,000 and $74,000. As a
reminder, $74,000
is my bearish target that
I have mentioned many times in recent weeks, where I expect reaccumulation
after weak hands are shaken out and a return to growth. However,
the weekly chart reveals that this $74,000 zone could significantly expand when
looking at local peaks drawn from March to July 2024. According to my
analysis, the $68,000 level particularly catches my attention, representing
the July 2024 highs, which currently coincides with the 200-week
exponential moving average, which price last tested nearly three years ago.
Breaking above it was the official start of the uptrend that pushed Bitcoin's
price from $23,000 to $123,000. The fact
that we dropped below the 50-week moving average for the first time since
October 2023 also gives much to think about and suggests that price may again head
toward the longer-term 200-week average I mentioned. This would expand my
bearish target nominally by $6,000, meaning Bitcoin could fall 25% from
current levels to test the $68,000 zone. The
200-week exponential moving average represents a critical historical support
level. Three years ago, when Bitcoin reclaimed this moving average, it marked
the beginning of a massive rally from bear market lows around $23,000 all the
way to the October 2025 all-time high of $126,198. Major
corrections typically revisit these long-term moving averages to reset
sentiment and create sustainable foundations for the next bull phase. If
you found this Bitcoin technical analysis valuable, follow me on X
(Twitter) @ChmielDk for real-time market updates,
in-depth crypto analysis, and trading insights. My weekly
chart analysis showing $68,000-$74,000 downside targets isn't an isolated
bearish view. Several prominent crypto influencers and traders have recently
published remarkably similar predictions, creating an emerging consensus around
major support in the mid-to-high $60,000 range. James Wynn published
a prescient call on December 17, 2025: ""$67,000 $BTC. 200 day moving
average on the weekly there. Said it since $120k. That's the next major support
channel. You have to hit them to have that 'flush' / 'reset'. - Wynn"" $67,000 $BTC 200 day moving average on the weekly there. Said it since $120k. That's the next major support channel. You have to hit them to have that 'flush' / 'reset'. - Wynn His $67,000
target aligns almost perfectly with my $68,000 extended support zone at the
200-week EMA. Brannigan
Barrett also provided detailed bearish analysis on January 8, 2026, noting
current price action weakness: ""BTC price action continues with weak
efforts to bounce. This is not a market to be long. As I mentioned last
year, $68k is likely to be tested. This is the 24' election
breakout. Sentiment remains sour and is confirmed by the markets inability to
bounce, despite being oversold."" BTC price action continues with weak efforts to bounce. This is not a market to be long. As I mentioned last year. $68k is likely to be tested. This is the 24' election breakout. Sentiment remains sour and is confirmed by the markets inability to bounce-despite being oversold.… pic.twitter.com/6XlKUbWvyp Barrett's
$68,000 target matches my extended support analysis precisely, referencing the
2024 election breakout level that now serves as major historical support. His
timeline suggests several more weeks of consolidation before the eventual
breakdown toward $68,000. Perhaps the
most detailed bearish roadmap comes from coko.nad, who outlined a multi-stage
decline scenario on January 5, 2026: ""Now, changed my mind about Bitcoin.
I am now expecting $98K - $99K. Then hard crash to $77K. Horizontal and no-vol
phase between $77K - $83K. Then, drop to $64K - $66K. Here is 1.5-2 month
plan."" Beyond
technical analysis, several fundamental factors support the thesis that Bitcoin
is going down and has further to decline before bottoming. Despite the
Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 175 basis points cumulatively over
2024-2025, bringing the target range to 3.50-3.75%, monetary conditions remain
restrictive for risk assets. The dollar has strengthened against major
currencies, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin.
Equity markets show stretched valuations with ongoing concerns about artificial
intelligence investment sustainability, factors that typically pressure Bitcoin
given its high correlation to risk-on assets. Institutional
forecasts showing BTC hitting only $150K in 2026 reflect growing caution among
sophisticated market participants. Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies that
accumulated massive Bitcoin holdings during 2024-2025 have largely exhausted
their buying power as valuations became unsupportive of additional capital
raises. From a pure
technical perspective, Bitcoin's failure to test the 200-week EMA for nearly
three years represents an anomaly. Historically, major bull markets experience
periodic corrections to long-term moving averages that serve as ""trend
separators"" between bull and bear market conditions. According
to my technical analysis, Bitcoin's downside targets break into two distinct
levels: As I show
on the weekly chart, the $68,000 level represents convergence of multiple
technical factors: July 2024 resistance-turned-support, the critical 200-week
EMA, and March-July 2024 consolidation peaks. This confluence creates a
high-probability zone for trend reversal after capitulation. Based on
historical precedent and market cycle dynamics, the expected scenario at major
support involves: This
process typically takes several weeks to months, suggesting Q1 2026 correction
followed by Q2 2026 reaccumulation and potential Q3-Q4 2026 return to all-time
high territory. Bitcoin is
declining due to breakdown below the 50-week moving average for the first time
since October 2023, weak bounce attempts despite oversold conditions, and
technical targeting of the 200-week EMA at $68,000. According to my weekly
chart analysis, current consolidation suggests continuation toward
$68,000-$74,000 support zone where reaccumulation is expected. According
to my technical analysis, Bitcoin targets $74,000 (April 2025 lows) with
extended support at $68,000 (July 2024 highs + 200-week EMA), representing
potential 25% decline from current $90,605 levels. coko.nad predicts even lower
targets of $64,000-$66,000 in 1.5-2 month scenario, while James Wynn targets
$67,000 and Brannigan Barrett expects $68,000 test. My primary
targets are $74,000 and $68,000 based on weekly chart support confluence and
200-week EMA location. coko.nad's $64,000-$66,000 scenario represents deeper
extension beyond 200-week EMA but remains within historical correction ranges.
Sub-$60,000 would require breakdown of all major 2024 support levels, which
seems unlikely based on current technical structure. According
to my analysis, significant support and reaccumulation expected at
$68,000-$74,000 zone where 200-week EMA and April 2025/July 2024 historical
levels converge. Brannigan Barrett suggests ""continue consolidation range
between 80-94k for a few more weeks"" before breakdown, while coko.nad
outlines 1.5-2 month timeline to final lows. Expect capitulation and reversal
in Q1 2026. Breaking
below 50-week MA (first since October 2023) signals correction phase rather
than full bear market. According to my weekly chart analysis, testing 200-week
EMA at $68,000 is necessary for trend reset and healthy market structure.
Expect reaccumulation at major support before growth resumes, similar to
historical patterns where 200-week EMA tests marked bottoms before major
rallies. Bitcoin (BTC)
trades at $90,605 today (Sunday), January 11, 2026, attempting a modest 0.24%
rebound after experiencing five consecutive days of declines. The world's
largest cryptocurrency remains trapped in a prolonged consolidation pattern,
down approximately 28% from its October 2025 all-time high of $126,198. While
many investors ask why Bitcoin is going down, the answer lies in critical
technical breakdowns that point toward significantly lower prices ahead. Potentially
$68,000 to $74,000 according to my weekly chart analysis. In this article, I explain why Bitcoin is falling and
why it could drop by another 25%. Check out my technical analysis of the

    Read this Term has
experienced five consecutive days of declines and during Sunday’s session
attempted a modest 0.3% rebound, changing hands at just under $91,000. On the
daily chart, we remain in the same consolidation and nothing particularly
interesting is happening. For a fresh
perspective, I decided to look at a slightly broader interval, namely the
weekly chart, which brings interesting observations from a technical analysis
point of view. As I show
on the weekly chart, we see exactly the same consolidation pattern and support
zone defined by April 2025 lows between $78,000 and $74,000. As a
reminder, $74,000
is my bearish target that
I have mentioned many times in recent weeks, where I expect reaccumulation
after weak hands are shaken out and a return to growth. However,
the weekly chart reveals that this $74,000 zone could significantly expand when
looking at local peaks drawn from March to July 2024. According to my
analysis, the $68,000 level particularly catches my attention, representing
the July 2024 highs, which currently coincides with the 200-week
exponential moving average, which price last tested nearly three years ago.
Breaking above it was the official start of the uptrend that pushed Bitcoin's
price from $23,000 to $123,000. The fact
that we dropped below the 50-week moving average for the first time since
October 2023 also gives much to think about and suggests that price may again head
toward the longer-term 200-week average I mentioned. This would expand my
bearish target nominally by $6,000, meaning Bitcoin could fall 25% from
current levels to test the $68,000 zone. The
200-week exponential moving average represents a critical historical support
level. Three years ago, when Bitcoin reclaimed this moving average, it marked
the beginning of a massive rally from bear market lows around $23,000 all the
way to the October 2025 all-time high of $126,198. Major
corrections typically revisit these long-term moving averages to reset
sentiment and create sustainable foundations for the next bull phase. If

chart analysis showing $68,000-$74,000 downside targets isn't an isolated
bearish view. Several prominent crypto influencers and traders have recently
published remarkably similar predictions, creating an emerging consensus around
major support in the mid-to-high $60,000 range. James Wynn published
a prescient call on December 17, 2025: ""$67,000 $BTC. 200 day moving
average on the weekly there. Said it since $120k. That's the next major support
channel. You have to hit them to have that 'flush' / 'reset'. - Wynn"" $67,000 $BTC 200 day moving average on the weekly there. Said it since $120k. That's the next major support channel. You have to hit them to have that 'flush' / 'reset'. - Wynn His $67,000
target aligns almost perfectly with my $68,000 extended support zone at the
200-week EMA. Brannigan
Barrett also provided detailed bearish analysis on January 8, 2026, noting
current price action weakness: ""BTC price action continues with weak
efforts to bounce. This is not a market to be long. As I mentioned last
year, $68k is likely to be tested. This is the 24' election
breakout. Sentiment remains sour and is confirmed by the markets inability to
bounce, despite being oversold."" BTC price action continues with weak efforts to bounce. This is not a market to be long. As I mentioned last year. $68k is likely to be tested. This is the 24' election breakout. Sentiment remains sour and is confirmed by the markets inability to bounce-despite being oversold.… pic.twitter.com/6XlKUbWvyp Barrett's
$68,000 target matches my extended support analysis precisely, referencing the
2024 election breakout level that now serves as major historical support. His
timeline suggests several more weeks of consolidation before the eventual
breakdown toward $68,000. Perhaps the
most detailed bearish roadmap comes from coko.nad, who outlined a multi-stage
decline scenario on January 5, 2026: ""Now, changed my mind about Bitcoin.
I am now expecting $98K - $99K. Then hard crash to $77K. Horizontal and no-vol
phase between $77K - $83K. Then, drop to $64K - $66K. Here is 1.5-2 month
plan."" Beyond
technical analysis, several fundamental factors support the thesis that Bitcoin
is going down and has further to decline before bottoming. Despite the
Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 175 basis points cumulatively over
2024-2025, bringing the target range to 3.50-3.75%, monetary conditions remain
restrictive for risk assets. The dollar has strengthened against major
currencies, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin.
Equity markets show stretched valuations with ongoing concerns about artificial
intelligence investment sustainability, factors that typically pressure Bitcoin
given its high correlation to risk-on assets. Institutional
forecasts showing BTC hitting only $150K in 2026 reflect growing caution among
sophisticated market participants. Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies that
accumulated massive Bitcoin holdings during 2024-2025 have largely exhausted
their buying power as valuations became unsupportive of additional capital
raises. From a pure
technical perspective, Bitcoin's failure to test the 200-week EMA for nearly
three years represents an anomaly. Historically, major bull markets experience
periodic corrections to long-term moving averages that serve as ""trend
separators"" between bull and bear market conditions. According
to my technical analysis, Bitcoin's downside targets break into two distinct
levels: As I show
on the weekly chart, the $68,000 level represents convergence of multiple
technical factors: July 2024 resistance-turned-support, the critical 200-week
EMA, and March-July 2024 consolidation peaks. This confluence creates a
high-probability zone for trend reversal after capitulation. Based on
historical precedent and market cycle dynamics, the expected scenario at major
support involves: This
process typically takes several weeks to months, suggesting Q1 2026 correction
followed by Q2 2026 reaccumulation and potential Q3-Q4 2026 return to all-time
high territory. Bitcoin is
declining due to breakdown below the 50-week moving average for the first time
since October 2023, weak bounce attempts despite oversold conditions, and
technical targeting of the 200-week EMA at $68,000. According to my weekly
chart analysis, current consolidation suggests continuation toward
$68,000-$74,000 support zone where reaccumulation is expected. According
to my technical analysis, Bitcoin targets $74,000 (April 2025 lows) with
extended support at $68,000 (July 2024 highs + 200-week EMA), representing
potential 25% decline from current $90,605 levels. coko.nad predicts even lower
targets of $64,000-$66,000 in 1.5-2 month scenario, while James Wynn targets
$67,000 and Brannigan Barrett expects $68,000 test. My primary
targets are $74,000 and $68,000 based on weekly chart support confluence and
200-week EMA location. coko.nad's $64,000-$66,000 scenario represents deeper

https://www.ainvest.com/news/bitcoin-90-000-rejection-structural-warning-2026-2601/,Web,Article,AIInvest,"- Bitcoin's $90,000 rejection in late 2025 highlighted technical resistance and macroeconomic headwinds, including Fed policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. - Institutional inflows via ETFs and options dynamics briefly pushed prices above $90,000 in early 2026, but rising U.S. inflation and fiscal deficits constrain upside potential. - Institutional adoption (ETFs, 401(k) allocations) strengthens Bitcoin's infrastructure, yet its high-beta volatility undermines macro-hedge narratives during crises. - The $90,000 rejection reflects temporary macroeconomic fragility rather than structural failure, with future outcomes dependent on yield trends, geopolitical stability, and institutional adoption velocity. Bitcoin's recent rejection at $90,000 in December 2025 has sparked intense debate about its structural implications for 2026. This price level, long considered a psychological and technical milestone, became a battleground between bullish institutional flows and bearish macroeconomic forces. To assess whether this rejection signals a broader warning for the year ahead, we must dissect the interplay of technical resistance, macroeconomic headwinds, and institutional positioning-a triad that defines Bitcoin's trajectory in an increasingly institutionalized market. The $90,000 level acted as a formidable barrier in late 2025, driven by a confluence of technical and mechanical factors. Profit-taking from investors who accumulated BitcoinBTC-- between $60,000 and $70,000 created persistent sell pressure, while open interest in call options at this level forced dealers to sell spot Bitcoin to maintain delta neutrality, effectively reinforcing the resistance as a mechanical ceiling. This dynamic was compounded by macroeconomic uncertainty, including the Federal Reserve's ambiguous 2026 policy outlook and geopolitical tensions, which kept institutional buyers cautious during the end-of-year period according to market analysis. However, the rejection was not a terminal event. Institutional capital re-entered the market in early January 2026, driven by strong ETF inflows and a shift in options dynamics. As dealers bought spot Bitcoin to hedge short call exposure, a feedback loop of buying pressure emerged, pushing prices above $90,000. Yet, the broader macroeconomic environment remains a critical constraint. Rising U.S. inflation, fueled by renewed tariffs, tight labor markets, and fiscal deficits, has reduced the likelihood of aggressive Fed rate cuts. This elevates real yields, increasing the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin-a non-yielding asset-and capping its upside potential. Bitcoin's institutional adoption has reached a pivotal inflection point in 2026. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and other jurisdictions has normalized Bitcoin as a core portfolio asset, with major institutions like Vanguard, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley integrating it into their offerings according to research. Morgan Stanley's promotion of 2–4% Bitcoin allocations and JPMorgan's use of spot ETFs as collateral underscore the asset's growing legitimacy as market analysis shows. Yet, institutional positioning is a double-edged sword. While ETF inflows have provided structural support, Bitcoin's behavior as a high-beta asset remains problematic. During periods of geopolitical stress-such as U.S.–Europe tensions over Greenland- Bitcoin has sold off alongside equities, undermining its narrative as a macro hedge. This volatility is exacerbated by impaired liquidity, with order book depth still 40% below pre-October 2025 crash levels. A critical wildcard is the potential inclusion of Bitcoin in U.S. 401(k) and Defined Contribution (DC) systems. A 1% allocation across these $22 trillion retirement accounts could generate $90–130 billion in steady, rules-based inflows, providing long-duration capital that insulates Bitcoin from short-term volatility according to investment research. However, this scenario hinges on regulatory clarity and a macroeconomic environment that supports risk-on sentiment. The $90,000 rejection must be contextualized within a broader macroeconomic framework. Bitcoin's performance in 2026 will likely be dictated by three factors:1. Real Yields and Liquidity Conditions: Easing real yields and expanding central-bank balance sheets could reignite institutional demand, but rising yields and fiscal deficits pose a bearish counterweight.2. Geopolitical Stability: Bitcoin's vulnerability as a high-beta asset means it will remain sensitive to global tensions, as evidenced by its 10% drop during the Greenland crisis.3. Institutional Adoption Velocity: The pace of ETF inflows and retirement account allocations will determine whether Bitcoin transitions from speculative asset to systemic component of institutional portfolios. Bitcoin's $90,000 rejection is not a structural warning but a temporary hurdle shaped by macroeconomic fragility and technical resistance. While the path to $100,000 remains contingent on easing real yields and geopolitical stability, the institutional infrastructure supporting Bitcoin has never been stronger. The asset's future hinges on whether macroeconomic headwinds can be offset by structural inflows from retirement accounts, corporate treasuries, and sovereign wealth funds. For now, the market is in a delicate balancing act-where institutional gravity and macroeconomic ceilings will define the next chapter of Bitcoin's evolution.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2026/01/26/bitcoin-downside-where-does-this-fall-in-btc-price-end/,Web,Article,Forbes,"Bitcoin has experienced a decline of 25% over the past six months and is currently trading below $88,000. This drop is attributed to macroeconomic uncertainties, risk-off sentiment, and diminishing institutional flows. Following a peak near $126,000 in late 2025, decreasing enthusiasm led to a downturn. The decline was exacerbated by leveraged trading, which resulted in forced liquidations speeding up the selloff. But where will this decline conclude? Before addressing this question, if you are looking for a potential upside with less volatility than directly holding a stock or cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has recorded returns of over 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? The stocks in the HQ Portfolio, collectively, have yielded better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it offers a more stable experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, refer to – Microsoft Stock Hands Over $350 Billion To Shareholders CryptoQuant anticipates a medium-term downside target of around $70,000, with a more significant pullback possibly hitting $56,000—Bitcoin's realized price where bear markets have historically settled. More severe scenarios have been proposed: veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests an 80% drawdown could drive prices to $25,000, while Bloomberg's Mike McGlone warns of a potential decline to $10,000. These scenarios necessitate catastrophic conditions—such as a hard economic landing, major policy missteps, or total institutional withdrawal. They represent tail risks, not base cases. The leverage flush that occurred in October 2025 has already taken place—resulting in $20 billion in liquidations. Futures open interest has dropped by 40% from its peak. The deleveraging process is finished, which lowers the risk of a crash but also makes the market more sensitive to institutional flows. The pattern? Sharp corrections of 40-50% tend to recover within 6-16 months. More profound bear markets, characterized by 70-80% declines, typically take 24-28 months to recover. The current scenario exhibits characteristics of both—not as drastic as the 77% crash of 2022, yet the institutional de-risking reflects similar structural challenges from that period. Bitcoin’s decline is not over. The near-term trajectory points towards $70,000-$75,000, with $56,000 being feasible if ETF outflows persist. A drop below $50,000 would necessitate catastrophic scenarios—an unlikely prospect considering the existing spot ETF framework, corporate adoption, and regulatory advancements. Recovery hinges on macroeconomic catalysts. A dovish pivot from the Fed post-May 2026 could stabilize conditions by Q2-Q3. Regulatory clarity would help restore institutional confidence. Historical trends suggest a 12-18 month recovery back towards the range of $120,000-$150,000 is feasible if these conditions arise. If institutional flows remain negative and liquidity tightens, Bitcoin might spend 2026 consolidating between $70,000-$100,000, delaying any real recovery until 2027. The market dynamics have shifted. Bitcoin now moves in tandem with institutional capital. The process of deleveraging has concluded. The real question is not if Bitcoin will recover—but rather when institutional investment will make a return. Keep in mind, investing in a single stock or assets such as cryptocurrency without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (that includes a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) providing strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a proactive strategy to capitalize on positive market trends while minimizing losses when markets decline, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.",January 2026,0

https://www.blockhead.co/2026/01/30/bitcoin-plunges-below-82k-as-crypto-selloff-deepens-despite-bullish-regulatory-signals/,Web,Article,Blockhead,"Total market cap falls 6% to $2.8T while regulators tout pension fund access and predict digital asset growth under new framework Bitcoin tumbled to a two-month low Friday as cryptocurrency markets extended losses despite bullish commentary from top U.S. regulators signaling support for pension fund crypto access and forthcoming market structure legislation. Bitcoin dropped 6.65% over 24 hours to $82,138 as of press time after dipping below $81,000 during Asian morning trading, its lowest level since late November. Ethereum fell 7.55% to $2,737, while Solana declined 7.2% to $113.89. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization sank 6.13% to $2.8 trillion, per Coinmarketcap data. Bitcoin now trades approximately 30% below its all-time highs reached in October 2025, reflecting sustained pressure despite growing institutional infrastructure and regulatory clarity. The selloff contrasts sharply with statements from SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Chair Michael Selig, who told CNBC on Thursday that digital assets are poised to flourish under emerging U.S. regulations. Atkins said ""the time is right"" for 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrency, provided guardrails protect retirees. The remarks came as the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced draft crypto market structure legislation in less than an hour, though the bill faces a lengthy path to becoming law. ""A lot of people are already exposed to crypto and other sorts of assets like that through their pension funds,"" Atkins said, advocating for a measured approach with investor protections. President Trump signed an executive order in August 2025 allowing crypto investments in 401(k) plans, potentially opening a $10 trillion retirement savings market to digital assets. The Department of Labor had previously warned fiduciaries to ""exercise extreme care"" before adding cryptocurrency to retirement plan menus. Selig predicted digital assets will thrive once Congress finalizes regulations, arguing clear national standards could bring blockchain firms back to the U.S. from offshore jurisdictions where they relocated due to regulatory uncertainty. ""If we can set the standard in the United States, really a gold standard for crypto asset markets, we are going to see a lot of new types of products, a lot of new types of onchain markets and financial applications,"" Selig said. Despite the regulatory optimism, crypto markets tracked weakness in risk assets. The S&P 500 slipped 0.13% to close at 6,969.01 on Thursday after briefly topping 7,000 for the first time Wednesday. Microsoft shares plunged nearly 10% in their biggest single-day drop since March 2020, following earnings results. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday as expected, with markets pricing in no cuts until June as recent data shows economic resilience. Traditional safe havens also pulled back from extreme levels. Gold fell 1.3% to $5,330.20 per ounce Thursday after touching a record $5,594.82 earlier in the session, though the metal remains on track for its best monthly performance since the 1980s. Silver declined 2.1% to $114.14 after reaching $121.64, still up more than 60% for January. As the Fed pauses, the dollar drifts lower and gold surges, Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum amid cautious expectations for rate cuts. Despite heightened volatility and macro headwinds, Bitcoin’s slide below $90,000 has done little to shake institutional confidence, with most investors opting to hold or add exposure.
