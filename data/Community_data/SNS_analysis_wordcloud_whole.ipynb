Herr Krall hat Bitcoin leider immer noch nicht verstanden Entweder will er es nicht verstehen oder er kann es nicht verstehen Leider labert er doch einiges an absoluten Bldsinn und Quatsch oder er lgt einfach Allein Bitcoin und Kryptos in einem Topf zu werfen ist der grte Fehler Das was der russische Berater angeblich zu Bitcoin und den USA ihrer Schulden sagt ist gelogen Der hat nie von Bitcoin gesprochen Hier mal ein Reaktionsvideo was mit den Lgen und falsch Aussagen aufrumt Herr Krall bleiben sie bitte bei der Wahrheit Sie sollten es nicht ntig haben zu lgen\n",
      "5844. Markus Krall hat bezglich Bitcoin einige Fehler gemacht Roman Reher hat diese in seinem Video gut aufgearbeitet Hier die Zusammenfassung 1 Falsche Zusammenhnge mit Zentralbanken Markus Krall behauptet Bitcoin sei abhngig vom Fiatgeldsystem da der Kurs nach Zentralbankinterventionen gestiegen sei Das stimmt so aber nicht Zum Zeitpunkt auf den er sich bezieht gab es keine Zentralbankintervention Richtig ist dass Bitcoin auf Krisenphasen kurzfristig reagiert langfristig aber immer besser abgeschnitten hat als Gold Das zeigt deutlich dass Bitcoin keine Folge der Geldpolitik ist sondern eine Flucht vor der Entwertung des Fiatgeldes 2 Missverstndnis des Regressionstheorems Krall meint Bitcoin knne kein Geld sein weil es kein Warengeld sei Er bezieht sich dabei auf das Regressionstheorem von Ludwig von Mises lsst aber die Hlfte der Theorie weg Mises sagte dass ein Gut zu Beginn einen Warenwert haben muss um Vertrauen aufzubauen Aber sobald es als Geld etabliert ist braucht es diesen Bezug nicht mehr Bitcoin hat lngst eigenen Wert durch sein Netzwerk seine Knappheit und seine Funktion als unabhngiges Geldsystem Genau das besttigen auch moderne Vertreter der sterreichischen Schule wie Saifedean Ammous oder Rahim Taghizadegan 3 Volatilitt und Wertspeicherfunktion Krall sagt Bitcoin sei zu volatil um ein Wertspeicher zu sein Dabei betrachtet er nur kurzfristige Schwankungen Ein Wertspeicher definiert sich aber ber Jahre nicht ber Wochen In der langfristigen Betrachtung hat Bitcoin Gold um ein Vielfaches bertroffen Wer 2017 Bitcoin statt Gold gekauft hat steht heute um Welten besser da Volatilitt ist der Preis fr Wachstum ber Zeit sinkt sie und Bitcoin bleibt trotz Schwankungen der beste Wertspeicher den es je gab 4 Goldgedeckte Kryptowhrung als Zukunft Krall meint Krypto habe nur eine Zukunft wenn es durch physisches Gold gedeckt sei Aber genau das ist das alte Problem das Bitcoin gelst hat das Vertrauensproblem Bei einer goldgedeckten Kryptowhrung msste man jemandem glauben dass das Gold wirklich existiert Das ist das sogenannte Orakelproblem Bitcoin ist das erste digitale Gut das ohne Vertrauen auskommt weil jeder die Bestnde und Transaktionen selbst verifizieren kann Eine goldgedeckte Kryptowhrung wre also ein Rckschritt und kein Fortschritt 5 bergang von Spekulationsobjekt zu Geld Krall behauptet wenn Bitcoin stabil wird wrden frhe Investoren verkaufen und dadurch neue Volatilitt auslsen Das ergibt konomisch keinen Sinn Genauso knnte man argumentieren dass Staaten ihr Gold verkaufen mssten wenn der Preis steigt Mrkte funktionieren anders Wenn jemand verkauft kaufen andere So verteilt sich das Vermgen breiter und die Volatilitt sinkt mit der Zeit Genau das passiert gerade bei Bitcoin Die Schwankungen nehmen ab die Akzeptanz steigt und es entwickelt sich immer mehr zu echtem Geld 6 USRegierungsprojektTheorie Krall greift eine Aussage eines russischen Regierungsvertreters auf und behauptet Bitcoin sei ein Projekt der USRegierung um Schulden umzuschulden Das ist falsch Die ursprngliche Meldung bezog sich auf Stablecoins nicht auf Bitcoin Es ging um den Genius Act in den USA der Stablecoins reguliert und sie als digitale Dollar strkt Krall wirft hier verschiedene Dinge durcheinander Bitcoin hat damit nichts zu tun 7 Diversifikationsempfehlung Krall rt dazu BitcoinBestnde zu reduzieren und in Gold zu diversifizieren um Risiken zu minimieren Doch die historische Entwicklung zeigt das Gegenteil Bitcoin hat Gold dauerhaft outperformt Wer auf Bitcoin gesetzt hat hat gewonnen Gold hat im Vergleich an Kaufkraft verloren Warum also den Gewinner verkaufen um den Verlierer zu kaufen\n",

      "6154. Also Herr Krall dieses Video ist Ihrer unwrdig Was Banken betrifft arbeiten Sie ja mit Daten aus erster Hand da Sie selbst ja aus der BankenrisikobewertungsBranche kommen wenn ich mich recht erinnere und selbst da ist Ihre Prognose dass es den groen Bankencrash noch 2019 oder 2020 ich wei es nicht mehr so genau geben wird jetzt 5 Jahre spter immer noch nicht eingetreten Aber in diesem Video geben Sie ja nur mehr Hrensagen und Ihre selbstgestrickten Narrative zu Besten Weil Bitcoin begrenzt und mit einigem zeitlichen Versatz auf die nderung der Geldmenge reagiert liegt es mit Fiatgeld im selben Bett und das ist eine schlechte Sache Ja Bitcoin steigt oft in Phasen in denen viel Geld gedruckt wird aber da steigen andere Vermgenswerte ja genauso nur stieg Bitcoin in etwa 15 Jahren von praktisch nichts auf 100000 whrend FiatGeld stndig an Wert verloren hat Also hier Bitcoin irgendwie mit Fiat gleichzustellen find ich schon sehr gewagt bei 400 es war kein technischer Fehler sondern ein Verkauf und ein Verkauf ist ein Verkauf Naja so wie ich es verstanden habe sind gehebelte Positionen zwangsliquidiert worden und das ist natrlich kein technischer Fehler aber auch nicht ein bloer Verkauf in dem Sinne wie Sie es darstellen also dass viele Leute sich aus freien Stcken entschieden htten jetzt Bitcoin zu verkaufen 500 Bitcoin ist keineswegs nur ntzlich wenn es sich irgendwann als Weltgeld durchsetzt wie kommen Sie denn darauf Das kann wohl jeder besttigen der in den letzten Jahren welche gekauft hat 540 Der Nutzen einen Geldtransfer machen zu knnen reicht einfach nicht aus Das ist einfach eine vllig aus der Luft gegriffene Behauptung die Mglichkeit den gesamten Zahlungsverkehr umzukrempeln ist wahrscheinlich einer der fundamentalsten Nutzen berhaupt weil er nicht nur eine einzelne Branche betrifft sondern potentiell die gesamte Weltwirtschaft Auerdem ist das nicht der einzige Nutzen von Bitcoin was Sie unterschlagen Einen Wert zu besitzen dessen Inflationsschema genau vorhersagbar ist und der in absehbarer Zeit praktisch berhaupt nicht mehr inflationiert also das hrteste Geld der Welt ist durchaus ein weiterer Haben Sie angesichts der Preisentwicklung von Bitcoin in den letzten 15 Jahren den Eindruck dass der Markt Ihre Einstellung teilt was den zu geringen Nutzen von Bitcoin betrifft 600 Bitcoin erfllt keine Wertaufbewahrungsfunktion Ja da haben Sie recht Bitcoin erfllt eine WertMultiplikationsfunktion was mir deutlich lieber ist Klar kann man sich mit Bitcoin auf Sicht von ein zwei Jahren in den Finger schneiden wenn man zum ungnstigsten Zeitpunkt kauft aber nach sptestens 3 4 Jahren hat es bisher jedesmal wieder sein vorangegangenes Top berholt und dann jede andere Assetklasse berflgelt 700 ja klar ist ein wertstabiles Geld der Idealfall fr die Wirtschaftsrechnung von Unternehmen aber das heit nicht dass mit einem schwankenden Geld kein Wirtschaften mglich ist Zumal mit einem das im Wert permanent steigt da wird ja jeder der es hlt automatisch langsam reicher Bitcoin wird im Lauf der Zeit immer stabiler auerdem gibt es ja Mglichkeiten sich gegen Schwankungen abzusichern mit Optionen Versicherungen etc wenn man es wirklich fr ntig hlt 800 Thema steady state wie stellen Sie sich das vor Dann kommt der ominse Tag X da sagt eine allmchtige Instanz ab heute ist Bitcoin im steady state und dann springen sofort alle Spekulanten ab weil sich das Spekulieren nicht mehr lohnt und deshalb strzt Bitcoin komplett ab Ach kommen Sie das ist ja ein absolut infantiles Mrchen Bitcoin ist ja nicht von einem Tag auf den anderen pltzlich in einem Gleichgewichtszustand sondern das ist ein Prozess der mMn mit Start des Bitcoins begonnen hat und noch viele Jahre oder Jahrzehnte andauern wird Und steady state bedeutet auch dann ja ein gleichmiges Ansteigen in etwa mit der Produktivittsrate Nebenbei Befindet sich Gold Ihrer Meinung nach bereits in einem steady state 900 Wieso soll der Charakter des Warengelds einen klaren konomischen bergang vom Spekulationsobjekt zum Geld gewhrleisten Dieser Folgeschluss erschliet sich mir nicht Wann genau war denn bei Gold dieser klare konomische bergang So ein klar definierbarer bergang ist meiner Meinung nach auch weder erreichbar noch notwendig Am Anfang betrafchten die meisten Menschen etwas als Spekulationsobjekt und am Ende die meisten als Geld dazwischen ist der Punkt wo man seine Meinung ndert fr jeden Menschen individuell Wie die Entscheidung ob man ein Handy besitzen mchte Heute hat fast jeder eins bei der Erfindung der Handytechnologie praktisch niemand Aber wo auf dieser Strecke dazwischen wollen Sie den genauen Punkt festlegen ab dem Handies zu Alltagsgegenstnden wurden 1050 Genau das was Sie hier fordern wrde ja ber kurz oder lang dieselben Probleme heraufbeschwren die es mit Gold gegeben hat einerseits dass Banken mehr Tokens bzw Banknoten herausgeben als Sie an Goldbestnden haben andereseits dass berhaupt gleich die Wertbindung der Noten ans Gold gekappt wird wie von Nixon Genau diese Probleme behebt Bitcoin indem es eben kein Reprsentant fr einen dahinterliegenden eintauschbaren Wert ist Auerdem gibt es derer Goldgedeckte Kryptowhrungen eh schon einige spricht auch nicht fr Sie dass Sie etwas fordern aber gar nicht informiert genug sind um zu wissen dass es dies bereits gibt\n",
